The
global
economy
is
on
the
verge
of
a
new
and
deeper
jobs
recession
that
may
ignite
social
unrest
the
International
Labour
Organization
(ILO)
has
warned
It
will
take
at
least
five
years
for
employment
in
advanced
economies
to
return
to
pre-crisis
levels
it
said
The
ILO
also
noted
that
in
45
of
the
118
countries
it
examined
the
risk
of
social
unrest
was
rising
Separately
the
OECD
research
body
said
G20
leaders
meeting
in
Cannes
this
week
need
to
take
bold
decisions
The
Organisation
for
Economic
Co-operation
and
Development
said
the
rescue
plan
announced
by
EU
leaders
on
26
October
had
been
an
important
first
step
but
the
measures
must
be
implemented
promptly
and
forcefully
The
OECD
s
message
to
world
leaders
came
as
it
predicted
a
sharp
slowdown
in
growth
in
the
eurozone
and
warned
that
some
countries
in
the
17-nation
bloc
were
likely
to
face
negative
growth

Moment
of
truth
In
its
World
of
Work
Report
2011
the
ILO
said
a
stalled
global
economic
recovery
had
begun
to
dramatically
affect
labour
markets
It
said
approximately
80
million
net
new
jobs
would
be
needed
over
the
next
two
years
to
get
back
to
pre-crisis
employment
levels
But
it
said
the
recent
slowdown
in
growth
suggested
that
only
half
the
jobs
needed
would
be
created

We
have
reached
the
moment
of
truth
We
have
a
brief
window
of
opportunity
to
avoid
a
major
double-dip
in
employment
said
Raymond
Torres
from
the
ILO
The
group
also
measured
levels
of
discontent
over
the
lack
of
jobs
and
anger
over
perceptions
that
the
burden
of
the
crisis
was
not
being
fairly
shared
It
said
scores
of
countries
faced
the
possibility
of
social
unrest
particularly
those
in
the
EU
and
the
Arab
region
Loss
of
confidence
Meanwhile
in
its
latest
projections
for
G20
economies
the
OECD
forecast
growth
in
the
eurozone
of
1
6%
this
year

The
organisation
called
for
G20
leaders
who
meet
on
Thursday
and
Friday
to
act
quickly

Much
of
the
current
weakness
is
due
to
a
generalised
loss
of
confidence
in
the
ability
of
policymakers
to
put
in
place
appropriate
responses
the
OECD
said

It
is
therefore
imperative
to
act
decisively
to
restore
confidence
and
to
implement
appropriate
policies
to
restore
longer-term
fiscal
sustainability
It
also
called
for
the
eurozone
to
cut
interest
rates

Italy

advantage
of

of
its

than
external
