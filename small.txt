 They                                   are also customizable.

                                   The carts are ideal for parties, events, promotions,                                   catering or just that extra touch in the back                                   yard or home movie theater.

        Well, I&#039;ve failed at entering the Beaux Arts School which literally smashed my self-esteem but the good news is I&#039;ve been accepted by the Atelier de S&#232;vres, in the second year "Interm&#233;dia" and it seems really stimulating.
 lots of new things to try and see !

        Euh je ne sais pas quand je vais poster de nouveaux projets (probl&#232;me pour les scanner, pas grand chose qui me pla&#238;t etc.
) mais au moins tout va bien, ou tout va au moins mieux vu mon d&#233;but d&#039;ann&#233;e tr&#232;s difficile et jalonn&#233; de remises en questions quotidiennes.
 Donc, c&#039;est maintenant avec un petit sourire que je peux avancer que ces &#233;tudes se passent bien.
 Je fais de la gravure sinon, enfin un petit projet mignon avec des mains de chirurgiens type planches anatomiques, que je voudrais retravailler &#224; la peinture.

Sep 2, 2008, 11:46:32 AM J&#039;ai regard&#233; sur Google et "Fraggle Rock" me dit bien vaguement quelque chose mais je ne sais pas si je le regardais plus jeune.

 I could have faved all your works seen how incredible they are (I especially like the fake silicone eyebrows and nose, that look so real) !

     he looks sad yet full of honor.
 like he&#039;s got at least one royal faithful subject.
 you should make him in 3D angel!
Sep 9, 2008, 10:06:12 AM Thanks for you view point ^_^ Actually it&#039;s just some still life we had to do in art school and I rushed it because it wasn&#039;t really interesting !
Sep 9, 2008, 1:04:30 PM If this is rushed then I&#039;m really looking forward to the interesting stuff!
        Art school going OK then?  --  
Sep 9, 2008, 4:55:29 PM well this is good regardless.
 and it&#039;s quite interesting so i don&#039;t know what you mean!
       keep blowing minds angel!
Sep 9, 2008, 8:25:24 PM Thanks !
 it made me interrogate myself a lot when I came back home, asking myself if I had my place in Art etc.
 However I still am finishing an ink sketch- arabesque, just for my pleasure, based on the story of "Hans my hedgehog" and will put it up as soon as I finish it.
 Thanks again for always giving me your opinion on my works even on useless plaster sketches  
Sep 10, 2008, 1:59:02 AM That does sound a bit harsh but I suppose the criticism is just designed to make you push yourself to create even better work.
 As for the subject matter - if it&#039;s any consolation, when I went to art school we spent the first three weeks drawing allotments.
 it was a pretty tedious exercise in itself but I guess it taught us a bit of discipline.
 This is why it bugs me when I hear people saying that doing an arts course is an easy life - it sure as hell isn&#039;t!
  I think everybody has those moments when they question what they&#039;re doing, especially when they hit a really steep learning curve, but you certainly shouldn&#039;t question your ability: you have a tremendous talent, and this is a great opportunity to develop it further.
Sep 10, 2008, 1:11:33 PM I guess it keeps me going, yes.
 I did a few sketches of some Auguste Rodin sculptures today and I felt really exhilarated while doing them, captured by the rough skin textures that were as hard to depict as exciting.
 throwing lines of the paper to try and translate life.
 As we have a A3 scanner at school I will finally be able to upload some better resolution pics !
 I never have minded drawing regular things as still life and such but I guess it&#039;s how the teachers bluntly judge what is not even creation but learning how to look.
 Ok, this type of sketch can become personal but it&#039;s still limited by it&#039;s "observation drawing" status.
  I&#039;ll keep drawing and I am likely to upload many rough sketches soon and I still have, also, plenty of ideas and desires but so few time !

 Detalhes adicionais para aqueles que no tem uma vida e precisam adorar pessoas como deuses: A msica de &#8220;desabafo&#8221; da gorda foi escrita por trs sujeitos: Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg, e Klas hlund (veja nos crditos do Cd, idiota - embora provavelmente voc tenha baixado).
 O que me leva a pensar que ela precisa de outras pessoas at mesmo para se expressar.
 Msica com a cara da dona: pedao de merda.

    Receba as atualizaes deste blog atravs de seu  
 A no ser que ela venha a ser sustentada pelas guriazinhas acfalas f dela, e das bixinhas que adoram a Britney.
Mas eu nunca vi uma letra de msica descrever to bem a cantora&#8230;    
07 s 08:20  Vc tb eh um pedao de merda, afinal, usar essa piadinha infame&#8230; Idiota, otrio, queria ser ela mas nasceu homem, bixa enrustida no tenha inveja da Spears, ela vende, faz sucesso, e vc s existe.
 contente-se com isso imbecl&#8230;      
07 s 08:51    No precisa nascer como ela, no mximo pagar bem para que escrevam e criem as malditas msicas, ter um bom assesor de marketinng e esperar pelos fs dela que no possuem o mnimo de educao e gosto.
uma cantorinha de buteco que se prostitui por um centavinho !
 vadia do inferno e ainda por cima baranga pora porra!
 tem cantoras que no tem talento mas so gostosas pelo menos como a nicole scherzinger e fergie!
 que alm de naumc antar porra nenhuma fazer msica pra viadu , ainda tah feia que eh o caralhUI!
07 s 12:30   Ento tem gente que achou graa nessa piada&#8230; ento t n&#8230; pra mim foi uma coisa bem nonsense e sem graa postar isso a&#8230; tem nada a ver sair falando mal dela a troco de nada&#8230;    
07 s 18:03  Ol; seu blog  timo, leio duas ou tres vezes na semana, em casa ou no servio.
 Continue trazendo entretenimento de qualidade, que  seu forte, no perca tempo com piadas infmes de artistas como BS; no sou f, nem ouo as msicas dela, mas apreco contedo inteligente e e entretenimento coerente, que no  o caso deste seu post.
 Temos coisas melhores e mais divertidas pra falar, alm de um opinio radical sobre uma suposta celebridade da msica, e  complicadssimo falar mal de algo que no  detestado unanimemente.
 Eu repito: nada me agrada no contexto Britney Spears, mas me agrada menos ainda perderem tempo falando dela negativamente.
 Espero no ter que ler posts tolos assim novamente, pois tenho gostado de quase tudo no seu blog, e acho voc uma pessoa muito inteligente e ao mesmo tempo comum, como qualquer um de ns.
 Abrao, espero no ser mal interpretado.
07 s 23:21  A nica critica negativa que faria sobre seu post,  que essa &#8220;cantora&#8221; no merece espao e tempo perdido digitando.
 Mas fiquei bastante impressionado com o lado da defesa.
07 s 20:01   Ah&#8230; Sei l, eu no concordo muito com o que o Gian disse.
 Depois, o blog no existe pra agradar aos fs em todas as postagens.
07 s 01:37  A questo  que em outras msicas ela j em tocando no tema, &#8220;ela mesma&#8221;.
 Musicas como overprotected, I&#8217;m not a girl not yet a woman, sao exemplos.
 Quer dizer, se Michael Jackson, fez sucesso com suas musicas freak, e ele mesmos sendo freack, Madonna, com musicas sexuais, Britney usa seu Lifestyle pra se promover.
 Agora sobre um comentario que ela vai pedir pao com mortadela??
 Se for pra postar acho que escrevam num nvel um pouco melhor&#8230;     
 foi por falta de privacidade, ii isso gera surtos&#8230;AMEII O CLIPE DELA, AMEII A LETRA, ENFIM BRITNEY H ESSENCIAL NO POPAMOO ELA PRA SEMPREE    
08 s 11:24   Oiiiiiii, eu tenho certeza que essa fase de Britney vai passar logo, J que ela tem muinto talento, embora no teja usando.
 Ela no entrou nessa s todas as revistas de fofoca contriburo para que ela chegasse a esse ponto, ela  uma pessoa normal como qualquer outra, que tambm tem problemas e as vezes fica to cheia de tudo que estoura!
 Mas pq chamar ela de louca? S pq ela faz coisas que as outras personalidades damsica no tem coragem de fazer em publico, como se irritar com um invasor de privasidade um paparazzo.
  seela  a melhor ou pior eu no sei mas a tentativa de se reerguer foi a maior prova de que se imporata com que acontece e quer voltar a ser o que era antes.
 para mim ela continua sen do a proncesinha do pop mesmo no buraco, pois quem  da realeza nunca deixarar de ser!
08 s 08:59  Bom apesar d nao gostar das musicas dela at q a batida das duas ultimas musicas dela  legal.
 Mas a britney nao  bonita como acham/ta certo q ela ta gorda poh mas vai ver a vida dela em 4 anos foi do cu para o inferno em meses.
 Da um desconto para a infeliz vcs falam isso pq vcs nao tiveram o previlgio de estar um dia inteiro com ela la super bacana porem  minha opiniao.
08 s 19:43   Bom eu gosto mt d Britney mas ela ta  fei porq se meteu no mundo da droga

 It showed her worse than those who justified this thing, the enormity of which she had seemed to understand well.

       Marc for the charms of his excellent lady, and I have been seen flying in the air in  
the figure of Julian Cox, which history is related with so much candour and truth by the pious pen of Joseph Glanville, chaplain to K.
 I am sorry to hear, Madam, that by your account Lady Mary Wortley was not so accurate and faithful as modern travellers.
 Upon the conditions I have mentioned, it was a scheme, congenial only to a man of a dark and plotting temper.
 Now to this system nothing can be more fatal, than for the public measures not really to originate with administration, but with secret advisers who cannot be traced.
 But, my lord, you  
craigslist portland oregon rental properties please to recollect, that there are certain attendants upon the person of the sovereign whom I find classed in that epitome of political wisdom, the Red Book, under the name of pages.
 Most noble prince, cried he, I am come to inform you, that you must immediately break with craigslist pgh beautiful Wilhelmina.
 That I can say nothing to, said Bromley, but, in my mind, her behaviour is gracious and agreeable enough, if her conduct were not so out of the way.

bellingham craigslist Cooper remarks, that the whole poem of Orlando is a tedious medley of unnatural characters, and improbable events, and that the author's patron, Cardinal Hippolito De Este, had some reason for that severe question.

 I have a story to tell.
       One day, the end.
  No, seriously, I went to Best Buy with my sister a couple days ago, and she convinced me to get one of the best games I&#039;ve ever played.
  I&#039;m not gonna give a review of Fallout 3, because I don&#039;t feel it needs me telling everyone how awesome it is.
 All that you need to know, is: buy it.
  Ok, I will say this about it: Fallout 3 is like a delicious pie that never seems to run out.
 You just keep eating and eating that delicious pie, until you get to the last bite, which tastes like mayhem.
 which is FUCKING DELICIOUS.
 Then you realize that the pie is gone, and you hopelessly try to gather up the crumbs for a bit more, but find that they taste like HARSH ABRUPT FINALITY.
  I&#039;ve only played it once through, but I feel it&#039;s worth another go, if not to complete the sub-missions and discover more locations and people, then to go on wild killing sprees.

       Depositary Receipts, including American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) and Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs), play an essential role in the global marketplace.
 Since the 1920's, brokers have used Depositary Receipts to facilitate settlement of securities transactions across international borders.
 In today's globalized markets, however, investors and issuers alike are using Depositary Receipts to diversify their portfolios and expand their offerings and shareholder base.
  Structuring A Depositary Receipt FacilityDepositary Receipt facilities are available in different levels and formats.
 Sponsored Level I Depositary ReceiptsA sponsored Level I Depositary Receipt program is the simplest method for companies to access the U.
 Level I Depositary Receipts are traded in the U.
 OTC market with prices published in the "Pink Sheets" and on some exchanges outside the United States.
 Establishment of a Sponsored Level I program does not require full SEC registration and the company does not have to report its accounts under U.
 GAAP or provide full SEC disclosure.
 Essentially, a Sponsored Level I Depositary Receipt program allows companies to enjoy the benefits of a publicly traded security without changing its current reporting process.
The Sponsored Level I Depositary Receipt market is the fastest growing segment of the Depositary Receipt business.
 The majority of sponsored programs are Level I facilities.
 In addition, because of the benefits of Depositary Receipt investing, it is not unusual for a company with a Level I program to obtain 5 percent to 15 percent of its shareholder base in Depositary Receipt form.
 Many well-known multinational companies have established such programs.
 In addition, numerous companies have started with a Level I program and then upgraded to a Sponsored Level II (Listing) or Sponsored Level III (Offering) program.
 Sponsored Level II and Sponsored Level III Depositary Receipts Companies that wish to list their Depositary Receipts on a U.
 stock exchange (NASDAQ, American or New York), raise capital or make an acquisition using securities, use Sponsored Level II or Sponsored Level III Depositary Receipts.
 Level II and Level III Depositary Receipt programs require SEC registration and adherence to applicable requirements for U.
 These types of Depositary Receipts can also be listed on some exchanges outside the United States.
 Level II Depositary Receipts are exchange-listed securities but do not involve raising new capital.
 Level III programs typically generate the most U.
 investor interest because capital is being raised.
 Generally, companies that choose either a Level II or Level III program will attract a significant number of U.
 Privately Placed and Offshore Sponsored Depositary Receipts (SEC Rule 144A / Regulation S)Non-U.
 companies can also access the U.
 and other capital markets through Rule 144A and/or Regulation S Depositary Receipt facilities without SEC registration.
 Rule 144A programs provide for raising capital through the private placement of Depositary Receipts with large institutional investors (Qualified Institutional Buyers or QIBs) in the United States.
 Regulation S programs provide for raising capital through the placement of Depositary Receipts offshore to non-U.
 investors in reliance on Regulation S.
 A Level I program can be established along side a Rule 144A program and a Regulation S program may be merged into a Level I program after the restricted period has expired.
 The Bank of New York Mellon is a pioneer in the development and utilization of "bifurcated" and multiple Depositary Receipt structures to facilitate offering structure and trading goals.
 Issuers Today, corporations and governments are using Depositary Receipts in global equity offerings and privatizations to U.
 investors in a variety of traditional and innovative ways to raise equity capital, diversify their shareowner base, globalize their non- U.
 shares, increase demand for their securities and improve share valuation.
 companies can issue Depositary Receipts to establish employee share programs, which in turn increases the number of Depositary Receipts issued and purchased; all of which leads to an expanded investor base and improved name recognition worldwide.
 Because they are dollar-denominated securities, more and more non-U.
 companies are using Depositary Receipts for mergers and acquisitions.
 InvestorsDepositary Receipts may be used by investors to diversify globally to help realize greater average returns and experience lower volatility than portfolios comprised solely of U.
At the same time, Depositary Receipt investors can avoid many of the complexities associated with international investing.
 For example, Depositary Receipts: Offer greater convenience and easy conversion - because they clear and settle within the U.
 settlement cycle or through Euroclear or Clearstream; Protection - because they can be cancelled and the underlying shares acquired; and Tax advantages - because they may facilitate the reclaim of withholding taxes on dividends.

 After the revolution of 1911, it gained its present name.
 Around the May 4th Movement of 1919, Peking University became one of the centers for revolutionary activities.
 Some of the revolutionary leaders, such as Li Dazhao and Mao Zedong , worked in the library.
 Many well-known scholars, including Zhang Shizhao, Yuan Tongli and Xiang Da, had been library directors.
 In 1952, after the nationwide readjustment of colleges and universities, the library moved with Peking University to the former Yenching University campus, and the Yenching University Library was incorporated into the Peking University Library.
 Peking University library also obtained collections from other universities, andit finally formed the present collection centered in the former Yenching University Library building.
 In 1975, a new library building was founded in the center of the campus.
 At that time, it was the best library with the greatest building area and the best building conditions in China.
 On May 4th 1998, the centennial anniversary of Peking University, the new library building was constructed, symbolizing the new beginning of the library's march towards modernization.
 The well-known Hong Kong entrepreneur, Honorary Doctor of Peking University, Mr.
 Li Ka Shing financially sponsored the construction.
For many years, leaders from party and state paid great attention to the Peking University Library.
 Deng Xiaoping inscribed the library's name, and President Jiang Zemin inscribed "A Hundred Years Book City" for Peking University Library.
 Through industrious endeavors byseveral generations of librarians and nearly a hundred years accumulating, the collection held by the library amounts to 4,610,000 items.
 In addition, there are many modern documents like audio-visual material, CD-ROMs, and databases in many disciplines.
The new library building is located on the bank of the beautiful Weiming Lake.
 In harmony with its surroundings, the new building reflects the simplicity and dignity of the traditional style, yet itobviously plays a dominant role as the center of the campus.
 It has become a symbol of Peking University's architectural style.
 Two out of eight stories of the central building are underground, and two wings are integrated with the central building via corridor.
 A modular structure was adopted, forming a wide open space.
 In addition, the library has a multi-purpose cabling system with more than 1000 terminals suitable for open stack and adjustment, which meets the needs of modern and digital library development.
The new library opened at the end of 1998.
 The total building area amounts to 51,000 square meters, with 4,000 seats.

First, a day after my Mom&#8217; birthday, my Dad had a stroke on the morning of December 17th.
 Its maddening this happened to him as he takes care of himself really well.
 He walks 3 miles a day - every day - and does weight training with dumbbells three times a week.
 He listens to his doctors, takes his meds regularly as well as a regimen of vitamins.
 Yet, he had a stroke that left him paralyzed on his left side.
 It turns out it was his meds that led to the stroke.
 Dad has an inherited heart condition (his mom died from it) where his heart beats too fast and the meds are supposed to keep his heart rate in the 60-70/bpm range.
 On the day of his stroke his heart rate was down to the high 30s - low 40s  not good at all.
 What happened is his heart rate was so low for a long enough time to where the blood pooled in his heart and formed a clot.
 When the clot traveled to his brain, he blew a small embolism and had a stroke.
 When I was finally able to speak to him a few days later on my birthday, he was not in a good mood.
 It was the most depressed and despondent I have ever heard him.
 In fact, throughout my entire life, I dont recall my father being depressed  ever.
 He was on the phone with me only for a minute - long enough to say (in an unaccustomed, slurred voice), Happy birthday.
 They tell me Im going to get better&I think theyre full of shit&here, talk to your mother.
Dad was in a grand funk and didnt even want to live.
 To tell the truth, I empathize with that mind set.
 Id be much the same way if I took care of my health the way he has, walked three miles and lifted weights one day and the very next you cant do that any more.
 Id be pissed and depressed and not want to live if I couldnt do things for myself any longer.
 Over the long run though, I know he will get through this  Dads no quitter.
 On Christmas, Mom said his temperament wasnt much better.
 I gave him a call.
 I wasnt going to give him pity or sympathy  Dad doesnt like that  neither do I.
 Instead I gave him support and encouragement.
 I asked about his therapy and he perked up when he talked about how tough it was and how tired hed get afterward.
 It made him feel like he was doing something, making progress.
 I didnt want to tell him to fight  I was afraid hed say he didnt want to fight and struggle.
 Instead, I told Dad hes always been a hard worker and this is just another job, another project to work on.
 That hes always had great self-discipline to get things done and to work with what he had available to him.
 I told him hes still the same guy that made an engine gasket out of cardboard, and a great kids sled out of scrap aircraft aluminum.
 He always finds a way over, around or through a problem or obstacle.
 I told him I have complete confidence that he is going to approach his therapy and recovery with the same discipline, creativity and work ethic that he does everything else.
 Mom said later that the calls my sisters and I made to him on Christmas gave him a lift and turned his attitude around.
 He was motivated and determined to do the best he can&and I know he will.
&#8211; The second issue has to do with my older brother.
  He has contracted Hepatitis-C and is very ill.
 He moved back east from California, and is living with a friend in Connecticut.
 He is in a program through Yale University Hospital, waiting for a liver transplant.
 Without it he will die.
 He told me the way the list works is not first-come-first-served, but whoever is sickest is highest on the list, and I guess hes pretty high up on the list.
 I heard from him a couple of times in early December, but Mom said hes been going through a bad stretch at the moment and is too ill to communicate with anyone right now.
 Last Friday, I went back to work on revisions of my latest novel from this years NaNo efforts, but stalled out again over the weekend.
 I will get back to it because I am my fathers son and will use his same determination to finish it.
All I can do for now is hope and intend that Dad and my brothers health improves markedly and that everyone else in the extended family find their ways to better health and living in 2009.
 Is writing supposed to be this much fun?
 It never was before.
At 85,475 words, I have completed the first draft of my novel Apocalypse Z: The Beginning 
It&#8217;s an almost indescribably good feeling to finish a novel length manuscript.
 To complete a story which came from some mysterious place deep within you.
 And for the first time, you feel it is really, actually - good.
 I&#8217;m now sitting here enjoying a tumbler of bourbon - no ice, no water - in quiet celebration.
I&#8217;ve never in my life written so much, so quickly while having so much fun with it.
 Perhaps it&#8217;s that I found my writing voice, my genre, my niche?
 I&#8217;m not sure which it is - maybe it&#8217;s all three.
 The story and the words just flowed.
 I still have ideas and images in my head on what I&#8217;m going change during the revision process.
 I know that before you begin the revision process you&#8217;re supposed to put the manuscript away for a couple of weeks before coming back to it.
 This time, I feel that would be a mistake.
 I have the momentum, the energy and the enthusiasm for this story, so I&#8217;m going to begin the re-writing process right after we get home from our Thanksgiving Day family dinner.
 I wanna get things moving while the ideas are still fresh in my mind.
     Still&nbsp;Crankin&#8217;November 24, 2008   Although I smashed through the 50k goal this past Saturday (earlier than ever before), and with a current word count of 67,292 - I&#8217;m still not done writing the story.
I&#8217;m continually amazed how smoothly things are going and how much writing is getting done on a day-to-day basis.
 There is, however, a real danger which has raised its ugly head.
 As I continue writing and developing the story along the lines originally outlined, there has been a series of nagging, persistent thoughts entering my head on what I want to add and change in the story.
 I&#8217;ve been fighting to resist these thoughts and urgings as it would totally mess me up if I try and implement them now.
 What I have been doing is jotting these ideas down on a notepad - so they don&#8217;t vaporize into the ether - because they are actually pretty good and can really enhance the experience of the story.
So it looks as though I&#8217;ll be ready to dive into a first revision as soon as I&#8217;ve completed this first draft.
 I just hope the enthusiasm and energy I have now lasts through at least the first revision.
November 21, 2008   Im not sure whats happening, but am I glad that it is.
 Ive been more prolific over the past few days than I ever have.
 My writing productivity has taken off like a rocket.
 Ive written more than 20,000 words in less than 3 days.
 Theres been a lot of extra hours spent in front of the home PC, but Ive hardly noticed.
 This is a blast.
 I spent the first couple of weeks building suspense into the story and it was kind of a slog.
 Now the good stuff the exciting stuff is happening, my fingers cant keep up with the story at the pace it evolves in my mind.
 As Im writing, I can actually see a full color, 3-D movie playing in my head.
 It doesnt feel so much like Im writing the story and the movie is happening  but rather the movie is happening and Im scrambling to record what Im seeing.
 This is such a cool experience.
Even though my word count is currently 48,505  putting me right on top of the 50k goal  Im far from finished.
 The way the story is moving I feel Im just past the mid-way point.
 If I keep writing at the pace I have been, I should be able to finish the novel by the 30th.
       The Urge to&nbsp;WriteNovember 20, 2008   Recently, Ive had a personal close friend and a young friend, from the NaNo Forums, ask me how to get motivated to start and keep writing.
 This was my response to them.
Most of us have a story to tell  a book inside each of us just busting to get out.
 The difference is the vast majorities of us never take the time and put in the effort to get it down on the page.
 For most it&#8217;s a lack of confidence.
 They tell themselves, My stuff isn&#8217;t any good&nobodyll want to read it.
 Others get scared off when they realize just how much of a commitment it is and how much work is really involved in writing a story.
In order to write any manuscript of any length - you need to have a passion for writing.
 I also think you need to write for yourself and not worry about anyone else.
 I believe it was Harlan Ellison who said, I couldn&#8217;t find anything to read that appealed to me, so I wrote stories I wanted to read.
 This has worked out pretty well for him so far.
For this year&#8217;s NaNoWriMo, I was going to write another thriller which I thought people might like to read - but I wasn&#8217;t enthusiastic about it.
 I then decided to write for myself.
 I explain why I changed gears here:  
com/2008/10/28/switchin-gears/If you really, truly want to write - you&#8217;ll write.
 The next day you fill up the pot with the cold water of initial thought, sit in front of the page and keep the heat of thought on it until it begins to boil over again&#8230;.
     Smooth&nbsp;SailingNovember 18, 2008   I finally got out of the funk I was in last week.
 I think a big part of the problem was that the company I work for was facing a major RIF.
 I happily made it through those cuts.
 It was a big relief and it helped me to put my focus and energy back on my writing.
 The words are flowing again.
 Every day now I can hardly wait to get home from my job to work on my novel.
 Its kind of like a writers version of a runners high.
Ive been having such a good time with it; I forgot to remark on the passing of the half-way point of the month and passing the half-way mark of the word count.
 Im up over 28,000 words now.
 Ive cranked out 13,000 words in 7 days and for me, thats pretty good.
 Id love to be able to write 4,000 words a day, but after a long day in front of a pc at work and another couple of hours at my home pc writing my story  my eyes feel like theyre gonna pop out.
 The good thing is I know just what Im going to write when I get home the next day.
Even though, Im more than half way to the required word count goal, like last year, I can tell this novel is going to be quite a bit longer than 50,000 words.
      Ebb and&nbsp;FlowNovember 10, 2008   Man, am I feeling bi-polar about this years NaNoWriMo.
I have a story, I know what I want to write and know where I want to take the story, but I find myself dragging.
 Dont get me wrong, the story reads well  better than I expected actually  it just feels like such a chore this year.
This aint got anything to do with the Week 2 doldrums.
 Like I said, I know where I want to take the story, I have a plotline to follow and make changes when and where they&#8217;re needed.
 The enthusiasm just isnt there.
 I cant put my finger on it.
, enough with the fuckin whining  Ill just put my head down and forge ahead.
 The interactions on the forums are the only things Im still enjoying.
 When ALL the fun is out of this endeavor, then Ill stop.
Last Thursday I was very enthusiastic and really in the flow.
 I produced almost 3,500 words of story.
 For my dyslexic ass thats a lot.
 Youd think Id be way ahead of the curve  but Im not.
 For that one 4k day, I had a couple of days where I just made it above the 1,000 word mark.
 Right now, Im slightly ahead at 15,500 words, and will shoot for the 17k mark tonight.
 Ill put myself in the right mindset with a jigger of Jack followed by hot cup o coffee  yeah, its different, but it works.
 What a drag |  
      Breaking the&nbsp;FlowNovember 2, 2008   Time flies&when youre writing your ass off.
 But it sucks when that concentration is interrupted.
I had a busy weekend, and had to take blocks of time to write my NaNo novel.
 Each of those time-blocks were gone in a blink.
 My wife was working, my kids were at two different parties and I was alone.
 Last year I had so many kids come to the house I almost ran out of candy.
 This year I bought extra and was prepared.
 I had one ( 1 ) kid come to the door - that&#8217;s it!
 Next year, Im going to a party.
Now I have waaay too much junk food in the house.
 In fact I had a sugar crash sufficient enough that I didnt participate in the Midnight Madness as I had for all other NaNos.
I had a lot to do on Saturday, but got up early enough that I was able to get a good start on my story before other obligations got in the way of my writing.
 Its amazing how quickly the time zips by when youre in the flow  and how annoyed you can get when that flow is broken.
 I was reminded of this when I later watched  
The Shining on Saturday night.
 It was the part before Jack Torrance totally flipped his noodle, but was well on his way.
 Wendy, his wife, came in to see how Jack was doing, forcing Jack to stop typing.
 He proceeded to tell her how pissed he was with the interruptions as it broke his concentration and how long and difficult it was to get it back.
 I can totally appreciate that.
        12 Hours til Go&nbsp;TimeOctober 31, 2008   In a half-a-day from this point the madness once again begins.
 It still feels like Christmas Eve for writers.
 The sensation and anticipation is exciting.
 If you dont  why in hell bother?I can just feel it.
 Thousands of writers out there: coffee cups at the ready for that first serving of caffeinated beverage, pads of paper, stashes of snacks nearby, assorted books and a variety of writing utensils ready to go.
 For some it will include aspirin, anti-anxiety meds, and a clear spot on their desk on which to bang their head  and booze  lots of booze.
Once the Trick-o-Treat kiddos are gone for the night, Ill be settling in online.
 Ill be impressed if the NaNo site remains online tonight and all day tomorrow.
 I have a friend visiting from another state this weekend, so I need to make as much writing headway tonight as possible.
 Ill have to write at least 3,000 words to stay on track.
          Free eBooks - For a Limited&nbsp;TimeOctober 30, 2008   A couple of my favorite new media novelists are offering their newest books for FREE as an eBook download.
 However, they&#8217;re only available for a very limited time.

 Footnote 4: Probably because Zeus was especially concerned, both with the fulfilment of promises and with the Olympic games.
 The ostensible reason for introducing the story is that Kyrene had been colonised from the island of Thera by the descendants of the Argonaut Euphemos, according to the prophecy of Medea related at the beginning of the ode.
 Him did Idas, wroth for his oxen, smite with a bronze spearhead, when from his watch upon Taygetos Lynkeus had seen them sitting within a hollow oak; for he of all men walking the earth had keenest eyes.
 Only as we are alone and as Pascal never reappears before dinner, we might assure ourselves of what there is in there, might we not? This work was their only means of living, the son having been obliged to give up all labor.
 And he planted himself firmly on his legs with his air of ferocious mockery, while his fiery red face seemed to flame and burn.
 We started, as I have said, from Plassans, and here we are now arrived once more at Plassans.
 Your mother has predominated in you; you have her fine intelligence, and you have also something of her coquetry, at times of her indolence and of her submissiveness.
 Then he opened a drawer of his table and threw the key into it, as he used to do formerly.
 And the doctor was obliged to prevaricate a little to console her, for he himself expected hourly the inevitable termination.
 Pascal was at heart glad of the quarrel with his mother, which freed him from the continual annoyance of her visits.
 This, however, was only a momentary feeling, unconscious in the one, hardly suspected by the other, and  
what remained was the evident disapprobation of the economical servant, condemning the present with her sidelong glance.

Welcome to the game of Empire on the HPe3000.
  It is a wargame of strategyoriginally developed at the Evergreen State College in Olympia Washingtonin 1973 on an HP2000C computer.
  It allows for up to 255 simultaneous players at anyone time.
  The game is played using a terminal emulator with "Telnet" or"VT/Mgr" protocol(Telnet usually comes free with many operating systems, but the"free" one is usually limited to VT-100 emulation.
)  Ifyou do not have a terminal emulator that uses oneof these protocols, you can probably download one.
  Thereare two good ones that I know of 1)   
QCTermis a good one for Window and2)   
/xhpterm a variantof freevt3k, works for many Unix or Linux boxes.
  Once you have configured your terminal emulator,have it connect to the following IP address:198.
111 or the domain name hp3000.
You will get a EMPIRECLASSIC: prompt.
At this point you need to enter a "HELLO" command.
Since there may several games of Empire running at any onetime and any number of other text "adventure" type games,the appropriate log on is below is typical.
If you care to show an identity the &lt yourname&gt is optional,it can be something intimidating to other players.
  The only requirement is that it be 8 characters or less and muststart with a letter (no wierd punctuation characters.
)Also due to cheaters, the game now requires each Player beprovided a unique user id.
  Contact the Sysadmin shown atthe bottom of this web page.

The &lt;yourname&gt; followed by a comma is optional,it must be 8 characters or less and start with a letter.
(Of course, do not use the "&lt;" and "&gt;" symbols.
)  There are also 10 accounts for custom/private gamesin accounts named EMPIREC#.
   Such games are perfect for educators as a classroomproject in human interaction.
  All that needs to be done is contact  
)    You may use anything for (yourname) as long as it is 8 characters or less  and starts with a letter.
  Also I have added some personal hints  and implied functions that can be inferred from playing but are not  explicitly stated by reading the online documentation.
  If you feel  brave however, you can glean self-instruction by typing "HELP COMMANDS"  once you have already logged on.
    Examples shown in the  links below are taken from actual games against  real world opponents.
  If the names of your Islands or Nations look  familiar, it is because I created a faux opponent to play against you.
  Therefore it is possible your Empire may be recorded in this Web page's  archive forever!

Empire is a continuing world exploration and conquest game.
Up to 255 players manage their respective nations in an attemptto gain more world power.

Do you wish to create a new game (Y)?
 yEmpire has several default settings which establish the basicsize and duration of the game.

  If played to completion     the game would last about a month.
 PRACTICE/LEARNING     This is a good skill development level for several players     who have developed a basic understanding of the game.
     The world is 399 X 399 with 20 islands.
  Land time accumulates     at the rate of 100 per day, ship time every 12 hours.
     The game will last 7 weeks.
 NORMAL (Information Hiding)     This is a game for skilled players where the presence of     other players must be discovered - by sighting them.
  The world is 499 X 499 with 50 islands.
     Land time accumulates at 50 units per day, which ship time     refreshing every 18 hours.
 The game will last just under     15 weeks.
 TOURNAMENT (Classic Start)     This variation features a "classic" starting method, where     sanctuaries all start on island #1, named Eden.
 When this     island fills, sanctuaries start falling on island #2, etc.
     All sanctuary islands are RELEASED, thus are visible to all.
     This variation is played on a 599 X 599 world, with 99 islands.
     Land time accumulates at a rate of 1 unit per hour, with     ship time accumulating every 18 hours.
 The game will last     nearly 7 months (5000 hours).

At this point you may lend some guidance as to how large theindividual islands will be.
  If you are playing a "Classic" game,you can directly specify the size of island #1 (Eden).
In the "Classic" game, the location of Eden is always known toall players.
  If you are not using the "Classic" starting logic,island #1 is just another island located somewhere in the world.
You may guide the creation process as to the general size ofblocks of islands by indicating a general island size intotal sectors.
Empire will prompt for number, min and max size, and willsupply a default.
  The number indicates how many islands youwish to create in this size range.
  The min and max control theminimum and maximum land area respectively.

Empire is a continuing world exploration and conquest game.
Up to 255 players manage their respective nations in an attemptto gain more world power.
  Each player starts with meager holdingsbut is able to expand their initial territory.
  With careful planningand skillful statesmanship your industrial base will developenabling you to build artillery, aircraft and naval shipping.
With ships, you can explore the world and spread your populationfar and wide.
The game requires data files which, in the case of large games,can take quite a bit of CPU and wall time to construct.
 FULL SIZED     This selection is designed for a large group of seasoned     players.
  The world is sized at 999 X 999 with all     255 islands created and time accumulating very slowly     at the rate of 100 units per week.
  Sea time accumulates     once a day.
 This game is configured to last one year.
 EXIT     After reviewing these options, you may have developed     cold feet.
  Empire is designed for the hard core computer     game enthusiast.
  To quit, enter zero.
 5You now have an opportunity to review (and modify) individualgame parameter settings.
  By pressing  you can stickwith the general settings as set by the general sizing optionyou have chosen.
  As you gain understanding of Empire, you mayprefer to make slight modifications to these parameter settingsto develop a custom game.

Welcome to the game of Empire on the HPe3000.
  It is a wargame of strategyoriginally developed at the Evergreen State College in Olympia Washingtonin 1973 on an HP2000C computer.
  It allows for up to 255 simultaneous players at anyone time.
  The game is played using a terminal emulator with "Telnet" or"VT/Mgr" protocol(Telnet usually comes free with many operating systems, but the"free" one is usually limited to VT-100 emulation.
)  Ifyou do not have a terminal emulator that uses oneof these protocols, you can probably download one.
  Thereare two good ones that I know of 1)   
QCTermis a good one for Window and2)   
/xhpterm a variantof freevt3k, works for many Unix or Linux boxes.
  Once you have configured your terminal emulator,have it connect to the following IP address:198.
111 or the domain name hp3000.
You will get a EMPIRECLASSIC: prompt.
At this point you need to enter a "HELLO" command.
Since there may several games of Empire running at any onetime and any number of other text "adventure" type games,the appropriate log on is below is typical.
If you care to show an identity the &lt yourname&gt is optional,it can be something intimidating to other players.
  The only requirement is that it be 8 characters or less and muststart with a letter (no wierd punctuation characters.
)Also due to cheaters, the game now requires each Player beprovided a unique user id.
  Contact the Sysadmin shown atthe bottom of this web page.
Log On Instructions     Game Type     Size     Islands     Started     Expires     Days    
The &lt;yourname&gt; followed by a comma is optional,it must be 8 characters or less and start with a letter.
(Of course, do not use the "&lt;" and "&gt;" symbols.
)  There are also 10 accounts for custom/private gamesin accounts named EMPIREC#.
   Such games are perfect for educators as a classroomproject in human interaction.
  All that needs to be done is contact  
)    You may use anything for (yourname) as long as it is 8 characters or less  and starts with a letter.
  Also I have added some personal hints  and implied functions that can be inferred from playing but are not  explicitly stated by reading the online documentation.
  If you feel  brave however, you can glean self-instruction by typing "HELP COMMANDS"  once you have already logged on.
    Examples shown in the  links below are taken from actual games against  real world opponents.
  If the names of your Islands or Nations look  familiar, it is because I created a faux opponent to play against you.
  Therefore it is possible your Empire may be recorded in this Web page's  archive forever!

 It ishosted due to the efforts of gamemaster Tracy Johnson, the keeper ofall things Empire.
 and, of course, the largesse of his employer.
Apparently, the history of this particular version of Empire has beencensored from Wikipedia.
 This version, which Ben Norton abandonned in2003, when he and his merry band of Flooglites went off in pursuit of amythical C++/Linux port, is only tangentally related to the Empirereferenced in Wikipedia.
Ironically, the evolution of Empire fell to much_guest when he was notonly denied entry to the Linux port team, but also banned from theFloogle forums.
And in one of those satirical circle of life thingies, Ben Norton nowplays here.

TYPES    - August 26, 2002, Ben NortonDES        Changed the constant which assigns characters to sectorSTIPULAT   designations so radar installations changed from "("           to "!
 This will help in situations where the left           paren could be confused between a sector type, and the           start of a criteria.
  Example, TROOP ( would generate           an error, you had to use TROOP (D=().
WORLD    - Changed default WIDTH to 72.

ASSIGN   - August 12, 2002, Ben Norton           Fixed bug where a null ship number would cause an abort.
52------------MINE     - August 1, 2002, Ben Norton           Fixed bug where you can mine land sectors if you           own them.
SIGNON   - Fixed bug where sanctuary island was not released           if it had been discovered prior to first sanctuary           dropping on the island.
NATIONS  - Fixed bug where dead nations appear on allies and           declared enemies lists.
LAUNCH   - Prevented recycling of ship numbers by nations other           than the previous owner for 1 full ship day.
 This will           allow the previous owner to check on the sunken ship.
VERSION  - Fixed a minor formatting errorISLAND   - July 4, 2002, Ben Norton           Fixed RELEASE ALL and LOCATION ALL logic.
           Removed default (no arguments) as INDEX.
           Added TRANSFER option, to permit a nation with           naming privileges to transfer naming rights to           another nation.
GENESIS  - Cleaned up default settingsVERSION  - Added a bit of detail to unknow fog displayTYPES    - Deleted TARGET_TYPEIO       - Deleted references to TARGET_TYPECONVERT  - Changed COMMANDER to LEADERVERSION 3.

POST     - Added test for INFO_FOG.
USERS    - Added test for INFO_FOG.
RADIO    - Added test for INFO_FOG.
ISLANDS  - Added test for INFO_FOG.
HELP     - Cleaned up and added detail to the help text for           several commands.
DISTANCE - If on land, it prompts for island sector instead           of world coordinate.
GENESIS  - July 23, 2001, Ben Norton           Modified section where preconfigured games are           presented to the prophet during game creation.
           added INFO_FOG defaults, and modified settings           (world size, ship speed, classic start, etc.
           Also require confirmation of the Prophet's password.
FIXGLOB  - Added ability to change INFO_FOG using the prophet's           GLOBALS command.
EXPLAIN  - Modified text which explains the pre-configured           settings to reflect modifications in note above.
           Also added EXPLAIN_VERSION to document changes to           the current version of the program.
 The text can           be viewed with the VERSION PROGRAM command.
POWER    - Added test for INFO_FOG, to see if power info           is available to all.
TYPES    - July 4, 2001, Ben Norton           Added new element to GLOBALS array, INFO_FOG.
           INFO_FOG allows the prophet to control the amount of           infomation which is available to everyone.
 Previously           all information (nation names, power, etc.
) had to           be discovered.
PROMPT   - June 29, 2001, Ben Norton           Added COURSE as a valid command from land.
           This enables COURSE FLEET           to be used without first going to SEA.
COURSE   - Added check to assure user is at sea when setting           course on a single ship.
SHIP     - May 14, 2001, Ben Norton           Added FLAGSHIP keyword option, which will show           only the single flagship from each fleet.
           When used in conjunction with the FLEET keyword,           it will display only the fleet's flagship.
43------------UTILITY  - March 18, 2001, Ben Norton           Fixed the string overflow for when certain ships           strike mines.
IO       - Fixed PUT_MAIL again, to try and recover from           bad directory data placed into the directory           by previous program versions.
42------------BOMB     - March 16, 2001, Ben Norton           Fixed bug I introduced when I fixed the bomb location           in the mail notification.
41------------UTILITY  - Increased size of string to avoid aborts.
4-----------MOVE     - March 11, 2001, Ben Norton           When moving more than 999 civilians or military           to an unoccupied rural sector, the sector is           automatically designated either an urban or fort.
           Also fixed the abort when a quanity  32767 is           entered.
 I suspect there are many of these, and it           will still abort if a value  2000000000 is entered.
SPREAD   - If the sector which you are placing the excess           civilians in is not occupied, and is not a mountain           then if the excess civilians exceed 999, the           sector will automatically become an urban.
VIEW     - Re-read island file to ensure view is currentIO       - March 5, 2001, Ben Norton           Added test in PUT_MAIL when recycling messages           to look for a date which is greater than todays           date.
  Why these future dates appear is unknown           but at least we need to work around the problem.
BATCH    - Used FORMAT_SHIP_FLEET for "rusted and sank".
BOMB     - Used FORMAT_SHIP_FLEET for mail message.
           Also fixed memo handing when bombing ships to           hopefully capture attacking aircraft lost.
           Also fixed bug where the mail notification was not           correctly reporting the location of the ship being           bombed.
BLAST    - Used FORMAT_SHIP_FLEET for mail message.
SHELL    - Used FORMAT_SHIP_FLEET for mail message.
UTILITY  - Used FORMAT_SHIP_FLEET for mail messages including           ship arrivals, striking mines and docked.

3-----------CHANGE   - January 29, 2001, Ben Norton           Added password confirmation for CHANGE PASSWORD.
MOVE     - Fixed bug where when moving across less than 99%           land, the time required was calculated incorrectly.
           Also, entering zero for quality prompt ends move.
VIEW     - January 28, 2001, Ben Norton           Now ships doing a VIEW MINES, or VIEW BOARDERS           on islands which they cannot LAND on, will be able           to distinguish land sectors from water sectors.
DATE     - January 27, 2001, Ben Norton           Corrected Y2K bug which caused DATE to terminate the           program when an argument was supplied.
PROMPT   - The EXIT command now requires at least 2 characters           to prevent accidental exiting when typing E for           explosives.
 The OUTFILE command now requires 3           characters for similar reasons (only with ORE).
           Also made MATERIEL command available from SEA.
2-----------PRODUCTI - Added some more totals to the end of the report.
CENSUS   - Added mines to total power (not total materiel).
EMPIRE   - Added mines to total power.
  Note, mines laid on           islands which the player has never occupied will           not be counted in the total estimated power, although           they will be counted on the true power report (CENSUS).
GATHER   - Fixed bug where you could not gather to a ship on the           coast of an island which crossed the "date line".
           Also enhanced logic such that if you             GATHER A FROM (D=A) to (D=E) LEAVE 9           it will only gather from artillery plants which have           excess production.
  Previously, no sectors would           qualify on the from side since no sectors had more           than 9 artillery.
  Now production is considered too.
SHIP     - Fixed bug where SHIP report (multiple ships) would not           indicate the island number when the ship was in the           inland waters on the side of the island which was           wrapped around the "date line".
1-----------TYPES    - Added additional data to GLOBALS variable to prepare           for implementing time lock.
GENESIS  - CON file now built with larger record.
IPL      - SET_COMMON moved to INIT segmentINIT     - SET_COMMON moved inIO       - OPEN_PROGRAM moved in from IPL, plus READ and WRITE           PROGRAM procedures got a status parameter added.
MAINLINE - Changed initial startup logic to check for INSTALL           keyword from INFO string prior to opening data files.
INSTALL  - Added logic to load program user labels with data file           and lockword information.
SHIP     - Fixed bug where doing a SHIP report on a single ship           from land, where the ship is located in another           island's waters, caused you to end up on that other           island.
  Also added an additional line to the single           SHIP report if ASSAULT keyword was used in COURSE.
SIGNON   - November 18, 1989, Ben Norton           Fixed default island name for dropping sanctuaries           to match default island name assigned by ASSAULT.
           Also directed nations which have no home island to           start at sea instead of island #0.
VIEW     - November 16, 1989, Ben Norton           Altered to set player knowledge to ENCOUNTERED if           the ship is docked (or in a waterway) owned by a           nation which the player had not previously encountered.
RADIO    - November 10, 1989, Ben Norton           Fixed my previous fix.
02------------SIGNON   - September 3, 1989, Ben Norton           Initialized additional COMMON variables like           RADIO CHANNEL, CURRENT SHIP and MAIL_OFF flag.
           Every SIGNON now checks all other nations looking           for any nation you have encountered for additional           information on other nations.
  If they have discovered           a new nation, then you get HEARD_OF information on that           nation.
USERS    - Nations which you have only HEARD_OF now still appear           as UNKNOWN NATION on the USERS report.
RADIO    - Fixed bug where sometimes a known nation would appear           as unknown when receiving radio messages.
NATIONS  - Changed the report format slightly.
01------------UTILITY  - August 29, 1989, Ben Norton           Changed NEAR_ISLAND to be capable of returning           island number 0 as the closest island.
  This occurs           during a batch run when a ship is not in any inland water.
CENSUS   - Disabled any news announcement temporarily.
SERVICES - August 13,1989, Ben Norton           Fixed NUMBER_READ function which was setting the           error flag incorrectly which caused RADAR to not           parse the NATION keyword correctly.

0-----------ISLANDS  - July 27, 1989, Ben Norton           Restricted ISLAND LOCATION and ISLAND RELEASE commands           so you cannot release island information to a nation           unless you have seen or encountered them.
SPY      - Added logic to flag nations as ENCOUNTERED when you           SPY on their land.
RADAR    - July 2, 1989, Ben Norton           Nation's which you spot with RADAR will be flagged           as "seen" in your PLAYER_INDEX.
  RADAR now supports           a new keyword SUMMARY, which summarizes multiple ships           owned by the same nation, at the same location on a           single line during output.
  You can also select multiple           nations on a single request: RADAR NATION 45 NATION 23           Another new keyword FOREIGN, will eliminate your own           ships from the RADAR report.
TYPES    - July 1, 1989, Ben Norton           Changed many data structures including PLAYER_TYPE           to include PLAYER_INDEX and WAR_INDEX structures.
           There were additions to COMMON_TYPE, USER_TYPE,           MAIL_ENTRY_TYPE, MAIL_DIR_TYPE, NEWS_TYPE, SHIP_TYPE           and various other records.

           Also changed normal NATION display to not show home island           of a nation if you only know the location of the island.
REPORT   - Changes REPORT to award naming rights to the remaining           nation with the most sectors (not power).

  If input is           from a source other than terminal (type 16) then the           process is regarded as not INTERACTIVE (like batch).
           This means control Y traps will not be enabled and           conditional locks will be skiped (no lock messages).

 Archaeological remains of the ancient Maya include           pottery, skeletons, stelae, and tall palaces, temples, and ceremonial           centers.
                It is estimated that there are thousands of Maya Ruins in Belize.
 Only a few of these  have been found and even fewer have been  excavated by scientists.

BIRDING HABITATS IN BELIZEFollowing are some common species to be found in:        Coastal Areas and on the Islands - brown pelican, magnificent         frigate birds, laughing gulls, osprey, seagulls, ruddy terns, brown boobies,         and on Belize's first national park 
 Half Moon Caye         Natural Monument--the rare red-footed booby         Wetlands -  roseate spoonbills, great egrets, green,         blue, the not so common boat-billed and agami herons, northern jacana,         and the endangered jabiru stork at the  
Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary--as well as at other wetland locations.
             Grasslands and Savannahs - the fork-tailed and vermilion         flycatcher, a variety of tiny seedeaters, tanagers, and the ever-present         roadside hawk.
          Broadleaf Forests - montezuma's oropendula with its         colony of hanging nests in trees, blue crowned mot mot, great tinamou,         black faced ant thrush midstory, sulfur-rumped flycatcher, and Belize's national         bird the keel-billed toucan.
 Under         the protection of the canopy, however, there is still much activity throughout         the day.
 To optimize your viewing opportunities let your  
tour guide  know         your interests well in advance.
 The day-to-day activities of birds and         their annual cycles provide great opportunities to see them at their best.
         Feeding-  observe birds feeding in the early morning, evening, or at night depending on the species.
Grooming-  watch birds oil their wings which need to be groomed in order to avoid predators in flight and keep warm.
  Communication- listen and watch various species as they send out warning calls to their colony.
 The mating dance of males attempting to attract females is always something to tell friends at home about.
Mating - most birds breed and raise their young at the end of the dry season from April until July.
 This period provides ample opportunities to watch mating rituals, nest building, rearing of young or survival training for chicks.
       Migration- the yearly migration of North American birds flying south in December is a prime opportunity to view migrant species.
 It is helpful to carry a guide on North American birds as well as guides for species found in Mexico and Central America, as the plumage on many of the birds is different while they are on their "winter holiday" in the tropics.
Bird ProtectionThe Wildlife Protection Act of 1981 protects birds throughout the country particularly in the assortment of parks and protected areas designated under the National Parks System Act of 1982.
These national parks, private reserves, forest and nature reserves marked as protected habitats for birds, plants and other wildlife, make for excellent birding areas.

          The best time for birding is usually outside the hottest part of the day, making early morning and late evening ideal times.
 However, there are many sightings under the canopy on jungle walks even during the day.
 This makes birding a likely event on almost any tour that you take, however, if you have a strong interest in birding be sure to let your  
tour provider know well in advance so that:You have a knowledgeable birding guideYour tour times are set for optimum timing (e.
 a pre-dawn departure for a tour or walk)The day to day activities of birds as well as their annual cycles provide great opportunities to see birds at their best.
 Feeding - catch birds feeding either in the early morning, evening or at night depending on the species.
Grooming - sit back and watch birds oil their wings which needs to be groomed in order to avoid prey in flight and keep warm.
 Communication - listen and watch various species as they send out a warning call to the colony or the mating dance of males in attracting females.
Mating - Most birds breed and raise their young at the end of the dry season in April to July.
  This period provides great opportunities to watch mating rituals, nest building,  rearing of young or survival training for chicks.
 Migration - The yearly migration of North American birds escaping winter in December is a good opportunity to complete your checklist or view migrant species.
 It is a good idea to carry your guide on North American Birds as well as Mexico and Central America as the plumage on many of the birds you may be accustomed to at home will be different while they are on their "winter holiday" in the tropics.

  A country that can boast 176 miles of unrivalled barrier reef, hundreds of square miles of classic fishing flats, and intricate webs of emerald green rivers attracts more than just your avid fisherman.
  Fish cannot get enough of the Belizean waters either, which makes this destination ideal for a sport called &quot;catching&quot;-a favorite among expert fly fishermen and your average fish enthusiast of any age or skill level.
  The species diversity matches the assortment of fishing grounds and makes each trip truly remarkable.
  The fish want you to come.
             Fishing charters are available from all coastal destinations, from the Port of Honduras and Punta Icacos lagoon of Toledo to Rocky point on Ambergris Caye in the north.
 Most offshore boats launch during tournament time; however, the private angler does have the option to book a fully equipped boat any time of the year.
  Prices vary depending on the type of fishing, size of the boat, number of anglers aboard, time of year and port of exit/final destination.
               The Belizean Barrier Reef sports a wide variety of prize catches.
  Tarpon, grouper, cobia, barracuda, bonefish, rainbow runners, and triggerfish frequent the waters of the barrier reef and its outer atolls.
 The deeper waters beyond the reef sport sailfish, marlin, wahoo, mackerel, bonito, pompano, blue fin, black fin, and albacore tuna.
  Experienced guides offer bait fishing in the deeper waters or trolling in the shallower reef protected seas.
The offshore atolls offer superb fishing due to their remote location and unique geological features.
  Waters plummet thousands of feet only 200-300 feet from the reef crest on all sides of the atolls making these areas oases in a desert of deep blue ocean.
  Fishermen can access Turneffe Islands Atoll, Lighthouse Atoll, and Glover&acute;s Reef Atoll via charters or fishing packages from various fishing resorts and lodges on the mainland or on the offshore cayes.
    Fly fishing is your game?
  Come play in these waters and bring your camera.
  Permit, bonefish, and tarpon are the marquee species anglers cross the globe to catch in the flats off the coasts of the cayes and mainland.
 Throughout the waterways of the country, anglers will find success.
  While the northern cayes and inlets have established themselves as the dominant fishing posts, the southern regions extending from Placencia to Punta Gorda are quickly gaining a reputation in international fly fishing circles.
Belize boasts of a strong resident population of tarpon, with the largest members residing in the north around Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker.
  Tarpon average fifty pounds in the winter, while in the summer they fill out to well over a hundred pounds.
  Bonefish also have a year-round presence and are perhaps the most convenient fish to hunt.
  Step off the sandy shores of one of the cayes and you&acute;ll find yourself in a prime flat with no movement other than the flick of the bonefish&acute;s tail as he hunts for shrimp and the flick of your wrist as you fetch your prize.
  Ambergris Caye, Turneffe Islands Atoll, Glover&acute;s Reef Atoll, Tobacco Caye and Placencia are considered the best bonefish battle grounds.
 Prodigious permit populations have recently been discovered in the south of the country, where fly fishing is quickly gaining a reputation.
  Permit can be found near the reef drop-offs and anywhere in the flats.
  Other saltwater game fish such as barracuda, jack crevalle, and snook also offer the fly fisherman additional challenges during his stay.
  The fish here put up a strong fight and revel in busting your line and raising your blood pressure, so be prepared for a showdown.
  If fishing to the rhythm of the wails of howler monkeys and song of jungle birds interest you, Belize again offers excellent opportunities.
  Because of their convenient accessibility to the major ports, the Sibun and Belize Rivers and Black Creek are the most frequently explored waterways.
  The Deep, Macal, Monkey, Manatee, Temash, and Sarstoon Rivers in the west and south of the country also offer tremendous wildlife diversity in and out of the water.
  Tarpon, snook, cubera snapper, and the occasional jewfish roam the rivers year-round.
 While the formidable jewfish is the king of the lot ranging from thirty-five to 100 pounds, snook can sneak up to thirty pounds, cubera up to sixty pounds, and tarpon up to 100 pounds.
  Belize enjoys warm, semi-tropical weather year-round-a reason both fish and angler rush to its waters.
  A few times each winter, Belize will experience a cold snap that will yield great fishing prior, but not during the weather event, which may last 2-3 days.
  The best (and most successful) time of the year to fish occurs May through July, when cold fronts have stopped passing through and the sun never seems to disappear.
  While most species can be found year-round, many have usual stomping grounds during at least part of the year.
 20lbs and join their friends offshore.
  These juveniles make for excellent freshwater fly fishing in the back country year-round.
  Inshore waters around mangroves and brackish estuaries, creeks, and channels; also found in atoll lagoons.
  Larger individuals usually found in the northern waters around Ambergris Caye.
  Prime areas around Placencia include Crowe's Nest Caye, Normal Caye, Moho Caye, and Tarpon Caye.
  Snook  November-March  Can be found amongst mangroves; cannot survive water temperatures below 60 F so during cold fronts they general move into the shallower creeks and mangroves where warmer freshwater dominates.
  Coastal marine and brackish waters (may also enter freshwater areas).
  Bonefish  April-November  Come to flats to feed on shrimp in approx.
 a foot and a half of water.
  Larger individuals found in October.
  Mangrove-lined lagoons and flats, river mouths, and interior waters of atolls; best action reported around Ambergris Caye, Turneffe Islands Atoll, Glover's Reef Atoll, Tobacco Caye, and Placencia.
  Permit  February-November (March-May best)  Migration begins in February; catch and release only.
  Flats close to reef and in lagoon and river channels and holes; larger individuals found in the south of the country (Placencia to Punta Gorda).
  King Mackerel  April-June  Best caught via trolling and spin casting; travel in small schools.
  Near surface in open water inside and outside the reef.
  Sail Fish  January-June, particularly the week of the full moon in April and May  Heavily dependent on warm water; migration occurs due to slight temperature changes in water.
  Found inside the reef but prefers deeper seas outside.
  Grouper  December-April  Most grouper species spawn 3-5 days following full moons during this time.
  Found in coral reefs and other hard-bottomed areas at depths of 30-300 feet.
  Barracuda  All months  Eaten locally; contrary to popular notion, barracuda NOT a threat to divers.
  Mangrove shores and open water.
  Marlin  All months  Highly migratory; follow season and currents to remain in warm waters.
  Outside reef in warm waters, near drop offs.
  Wahoo  November-March  Travels singly; good sport and eating fish.
  Found near surface in open water outside the reef to a depth of 650 feet  Cubera Snapper  All months  Ideal for night fishing.
  Reefs and rocky bottoms in depths up to 130 feet.
  Gray Snapper  All months  Feeds at night, ideal for night fishing.
  Mangroves, sea grass beds, shallow rocky areas and coral reefs to depths of 60 feet.
  Mutton Snapper  All months  Coveted fish for consumption -catch your dinner!
  Mangrove shores, lagoons and rivers over sandy bottoms containing plants; also found over reefs.
  Bonito  April-June  Suspected to support a 9 month season in the Gulf of Honduras.
  Open waters beyond reef.
  Jack Crevalle  February-November  Bounced back after 1995 commercial net ban; run in schools of a dozen to a hundred individuals.
 One of the strongest fighting fish in salt water.
  Shallow flats near shore; also found in open waters and rivers.
  Blackfin Tuna  All months  Schools reported from Glovers Reef to Utila.
  Found near surface in open water outside the reef to a depth of 650 feet.
  Migratory following warm water; hot location reported to be 15 miles southeast of Glover's Reef's south point.
  Found near surface in open water outside the reef to a depth of 650 feet.
  Although guides and lodges have equipment to rent, most anglers prefer to bring their own gear.
  A quick stop at the tackle shop is not possible, so bring extra of anything you may feel you cannot do without.
  Definitely be sure to prepare for tropical sunshine.
Most guides recommend that anglers take a course in basic saltwater fly fishing before they cast their first line.
  The Belizean waters require a heavier line and rod to compensate for varying wind conditions.
  Confer with your guides and fishing lodge to familiarize with tidal action, seasons, and the proper equipment before arrival.
operators can be found throughout the country.
  All guides are professionally trained and licensed by the Belize Tourism Board.
  Each guide is familiar with the ecology of the area, the proper use and care of the equipment, and the handling of the diverse assortment of fish in the region.
  Moreover, professional guides exhibit uncanny patience and are prepared to troubleshoot minor problems that may arise to ensure a successful trip.
     Anglers can hook up with an expert via their fishing lodge or resort or by hiring their own.
 While lodges and resorts only hire licensed professionals familiar with the area and catch, be sure to ask to see your guide&acute;s license before the trip if hiring your own.
  For each full day of fishing, anglers customarily tip their guides 10-20 percent of the full charter fee.
    Over the past thirty years, populations of game fish have declined.
  The prime culprits of this decline are habitat destruction, pollution, and over fishing.
  Guests can help combat this decline through conservative fishing practices, namely catch and release.
  Catch and release fish include bonefish, tarpon, and permit, while most guides also release snook.
  Sometimes a fish is kept for mealtime-for the guide or angler.
  If fishing for consumption, catch only what your party will eat.
  When releasing, handle the fish as little as possible so as not to irrevocably injure it.
 Finally, when wading through the flats, be careful not to step on new coral colonies that may be found in the shallows.
  Much of Belize's marine system, from north to south, is federally protected, with many areas designated as World Heritage Sites or marine reserves.
 These areas and their inhabitants cannot be destroyed or harmed in any way and are protected by UN funding and regular monitoring.
  Check with your guide to see if the area you are fishing in has particular guidelines or restrictions that may apply to you.

  The Hol Chan Marine Reserve highlights and protects the Hol Chan (Mayan for "little channel") Cut, which is in the barrier reef some four miles southeast of San Pedro Town, Ambergris Caye.
 Established in 1987, the reserve--the first of its kind in Central America--includes a five square mile area of three distinctive zones.
 Zone A includes the reef (both inside and outside), Zone B includes the seagrass beds inside the reef, and Zone C includes the mangroves of southern Ambergris Caye.
 All three zones are closely linked and are interdependent.
          Buoys have been installed to mark the boundaries of the Reserve and to provide anchoring points for dive operators' boats.
 Since it is illegal to fish and/or collect coral within the reserve, marine life is present in healthy populations.

 A History of Belize  
    A Brief History of BelizeThe history of Belize can be divided in four major periods.
  Following is a very brief synopsis of these periods.
  You can view a complete timeline of Belizean History  
            Archaeologists estimate that at their peak, 1 to 2 million Mayas lived within the borders of present day Belize.
  Mighty Maya cities such as  
Lamanai dotted the landscape, with small agricultural communities farming the land between.
  The Maya civilization is divided into the Pre-Classic (1000 BC to AD 300), the Classic (AD 300 to 900) when the civilization reached its height of development, and the Post-Classic (AD 1000 to 1500) when the civilization fell apart and disappeared.
No one knows for certain what caused the disappearance of the Maya.
  Perhaps it was war, loss of faith, famine, or a series of natural disasters.
                     Christopher Columbus sailed along the coast of Central America in           1502, and named the Bay of Honduras which borders the southern part           of the barrier reef.
         The first settlers in Belize were English Puritans, setting up trading           posts along the coast of Belize.
 Various bands of ship-wrecked sailors,           buccaneers, and pirates established permanent bases in Belize, harassing           the Spanish galleons carrying gold, silver, and hardwoods from Central           America to Europe.
 It wasn't long before logging became the dominant           occupation.
 This band of rugged individuals took to calling themselves "Baymen" after the Bay of Honduras.
  Spain continually attempted to expel these British buccaneers from then Spanish territory, but finally signed treaties in 1763 and 1786 allowing the British to continue to harvest timber in exchange for protection against pirates preying on the Spanish galleons.
                          During the 1840's, Great Britain declared Belize to be the colony of           British Honduras.
 Development of Belize became more organized and multiethnic           through a series of cultural changes.
 The European settlers began to           marry freed slaves forming the Creole majority that still is dominant           in the population.
 Mexican citizens began cultivating small farms in           Northern Belize.
         In Southern Belize, the Kekchi and Mopan Maya sought refuge in the hills of the Maya Mountains.
  A small band of Confederate Civil War veterans settled in what is now Punta Gorda.
  And from the Bay Islands of Honduras, the Garifuna people migrated and settled along the coast of Belize.
            By the early 1900's, Belize had grown to nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
  But a destructive 1931 hurricane destroyed Belize City and by the 1930's, the economy was so poor that the residents began to call for independence.
  By 1954 voting rights were extended to all adults, and by 1961, England agreed to begin the process of setting Belize free.
 In 1973, the colony's name was changed from British Honduras to Belize and on September 21, 1981, Belize's Independence was declared.

                    Belize is blessed with an outstanding archaeological heritage of Maya           temples and palaces.
 It is known that the Maya occupation began as early           as 1500 BC, and although it began its decline in 900 AD, some Maya cultural           centers continued to be occupied until contact with the Spanish in the           1500's.
 During the Classic Period (250 AD to 900 AD), the population           of Belize exceeded over one million people, and it is believed that           Belize was the heart of the Maya civilization at that time.
 Although           large Maya cultural centers no longer exist, there is still a significant           Maya population residing within many small villages.
  For those who are interested in archaeological sites, the Belize Instituteof Archaeology has committed to developing locations which are easilyaccessible for the casual tourist.
  This does not indicate the Institute'stotal commitment to the vast archaeological potential of Belize, but itdoes allow visitors the opportunity to appreciate Maya history, as well asto appreciate the tremendous undertaking that is required to restore theMaya Sites.

 With 174 miles of protected coastline along the Caribbean Sea, hundreds of off-shore cayes, and the Belize Barrier Reef, the waters of Belize are a unique treasure in the sailing world of today.
  Whether on a private vessel making port, or arriving by way of air or land and looking to charter, Belize has dependable facilities and numerous tour operators ready to meet your cruising needs.
  Private Vessels and Ports of Entry        Those coming on their own boat should have updated and detailed charts         and GPS chips that clearly mark the conditions of the reef.
 Due to the         shallow seas in some areas, it is advised that mono-hulls with a keel         be equipped with a depth meter.
 All boats coming to Belize must check         in with the Belize Port Authority.
 The communications center follows V.
         radio channel 16 and H.
 radio channel 2182 and will direct boats as         necessary upon their arrival.
 There are two Belize Port Authority offices         in the country--one in Belize City and one in Big Creek.
 Visitors arriving         by boat to either Belize City or Big Creek will need to report directly         to the Belize Port Authority office, located within close proximity to         Immigration and Customs.
 Those arriving at any other port-of-entry can         handle all necessary procedures with the Belize Port Authority through         Immigration.
 Immigration offices are located throughout the country, allowing         for flexibility in planning one's port-of-entry.
 The following locations         serve as ports-of-entry for boats coming to Belize: Belize City, San Pedro,         Dangriga, Big Creek, and Punta Gorda.
 It is required that all boats are         cleared through immigration, customs, health, and currency upon arrival.
         To do this, visitors must have clearance from the country that they are         coming from, a valid passport, and visitors coming from certain countries         will need a visa.

  The fuel dock in Dangriga is not accessible by sailboats or catamarans, and the water depths for the fuel dock in Punta Gorda are questionable.
  It is highly advised that current depths and clearances are verified before pulling up to any fuel dock.
  Jerry cans will come in handy when looking to refuel.
  An up-to-date cruising guide will be a necessary trip-planning tool for boats coming to Belize.

           In recent years visitors to Belize have rated the "marine attractions" as the primary reason for coming to Belize.
 With an unrivalled barrier reef in this hemisphere the marine attractions are as varied as the natural formations that make up this 176 ml.
 Divers and snorkelers can experience  the barrier reef, coral atolls, fringing reef, patch reefs and faroe, each offering differing underwater coral formations and a variety of flora, fish and marine creatures.
The dive sites are varied and most dive shops have their "special spots" that they prefer.
 Some of the more popular spots include:  
 The Belize Barrier ReefSpanning Belize's coastline for 185 miles is the Belize Barrier Reef with dive sites inside and outside of the reef.
 Just outside look for Spur and Grove formations - narrow canyons of corals are great for spotting grouper and the occassionally eel.
Inside the reef, patch reefs are covered with hundreds of brightly colored fish and coral species.
For something a little different, try snorkeling or diving near a mangrove colored island "the nursery of the sea" where you are sure to find tiny barracuda, snapper and other fish whose parents you might have seen in deeper water.
Hol Chan - Belize's first marine reserve where the fish are huge and quite adapted to human presence.
Shark Ray AlleyStingray FlatsCentral BelizeGoff's CayeRendevous CayeSouthern BelizeTobacco Caye -  great spur and grove formations just east of the island.
Silk Cayes - home to the world's largest population of whale sharks during the months of February to May.
 Coral AtollsBelize boasts three offshore atolls: Turneffe, Glover's Reef and Lighthouse Reef.
 Together they easily provide over a hundred dive and snorkeling sites for the adventurous visitor.
 Turneffe Atoll, the largest of three atolls found in Belize, is 30 miles long.
 The water dept measures between 55 and 65 feet.
Some dive sites in this atoll are Hollywood, Jill's Thrill, Cabbage Patch, the Elbow, The Coral, Gorgonian Bluff, the Secret Spot, Birthday Reef and Rendezvous Wall.
Snorkeling areas are Bat Brook Shallows and Billy Bob's Shallows.
 Glover's Reef, which is most south of the three, is often overlooked.
 It has a diameter of some 40  miles with over 700 shallow patch reefs in its interior.
Diving sites include Octopus Alley,  Manta Reef, Hole in the Wall, Parrotfish Falls, Shark Point, Gorgonia Gallery, Long Caye Cut, Turtle Tavern and Dolphin Dance.
With the numerous patch reefs this is a great place for snorkeling as well.
 Lighthouse Reef is the farthest from the mainland but unlike Glover's Reef gets plenty of visitors.
 Depth near the reef is around 9 feet.
The great Blue Hole at the center of Lighthouse Reef is described as one of the best dive sites on Earth and a must for all advanced divers.
 It has a dept of 480 feet with stalagtites at 130 feet.
 Other diving sites are Manta Wall, the Zoo,  Cathedral and Half Moon Wall.
The waters off Hat Caye are great for snorkeling.
  Belize provides few wreck dive opportunities because many wrecked ships actually lodged atop the reef system above water.
 There is also little chance of finding valuables.
 Anything you find of value belongs to the state and cannot be kept.
 A couple underwater wrecks are:Sayonara in Turneffe Atoll - This was a transport boat sitting at 45 feet below the surface.
HMS Advice - Turneffe Atoll - This is the wreck of a British naval cutter which sunk to 16 feet on June 1, 1793.
  Much of Belize's marine system, from north to south, is protected with many falling under the category of World Heritage Sites.
 This means that these areas and their inhabitants cannot be destroyed or harmed in any way.
 Care must be taken when on dives not to touch corals or increase sedimentation onto them.
         MARINE PROTECTED AREAS   The Belize Barrier ReefBacalar Chico National Park and Marine ReserveHol Chan Marine ReserveBlue Hole National ParkHalf Moon Caye   Glover's ReefSouth Water Caye Marine ReserveLaughing Bird CayeSapodilla CayePort Honduras These sites also make for great snorkeling and diving areas.
   The coral reef systems of Belize are easily accessible to everyone.
 It is, however, advisable that you use the assistance of a trained tour guide, dive instructor or dive master and boat captain for best navigation.
Hire a charter boat from one of the many  
dive operators for private tours  
  Water Temperature - Water temperature usually remains constant around 70 to 75 degrees F.
 Higher temperatures are 80 degrees F.
Tides - Not usually a factor for dives because the range is small at 1 to 11/2 feet except in extreme conditions of tropical storms.
Winds - Northeast wind can produce huge swells which can make diving difficult on exposed shores in the north but this is usually steady at 5 to 15 knots.
Waves - Wave action minimal inside the reef or on the unexposed side of atolls.
Visibility - Maximum visibility of 165 feet or 50 meters.
 In case of storms the visibility  reduced to 65 to 100 feet or 20 to 30 meters.
   Various levels of dive courses include discover scuba programs, refresher courses, open water and advance open water courses.
 Certification is available for PADI, NAUII and in some areas NITROX diving.
Whether for the first time diver or the experienced diver; diving here will be a great experience.
  Most dive shops have all the gear you need but you can expect equipment rental to average for:Mask, snorkel and fins: US$6- $8Regulator and BC: $approx.
50 eachIf you wear glasses or have prescription lens in you mask, be sure to bring a mask with your prescription before leaving home as this service is not currently available in Belize.
  Costs for dive trips depend on the duration and other amenities provided like accommodation especially for liveaboard dive vessels and dive resorts.
The costs for dive courses range from US$10  for refresher courses to as much as US$400  for certified courses.
 These prices include equipment, instructions and dives.
2 Tank dives start at around US$35 and depend upon the distance of the dive sites from the dive shop pick up point.
  In case of dive emergencies, San Pedro, Ambergris Caye has a Hyperbaric Chamber which is accessible to dive operators 24 hours a day.
 A $1US per tank insurance fee is charged by most dive shops to cover the use of the chamber in the event of such an emergency.
 The medical staff has over 15 years experience.
      Hyperbaric Chamber Contact InformationSan Pedro Town, Ambergris CayeTel: 011-501-226-2851Fax: 011-501-226-2852Dive Course instructors are required to be certified dive instructors or dive masters before teaching dive classes.
 Many resorts have PADI certified instructors.
To get the most from your dive vacation, especially if you will be diving 2-3 times per day it will help to be in good physical condition.
Alcohol and diving don't mix so be sure to limit alcoholic intake the night before and the day of diving.
Bring your own snorkel and diving equipment for a perfect fit.
 However, dive shops will rent mask, snorkel, and fins averaging $5-$15/day.
Ask about the experience of your tour guide or qualification of your dive instructor before any commitments.
Bring along a waterproof camera and lots of film.
 Underwater photography will be a must.
DiversLightweight lycra dive suits or nylon "skins" work fine.
 They keep you warm on a night dive but for most dives, a swimsuit is adequate.
 If you need more insulation 1/16 inch suits should be the most you should need.
Don't leave home without your dive certification card if you have one.
SnorkelersThere are thousands of snorkeling sites of varying depths.
 If you've never snorkeled before it is a good idea to try your equipment in water you can stand in first.
 If you're uncomfortable, try using a life jacket for added assurance.
   Just remember to breathe steadily through your mouth - once you get a glimpse of what lies beneath the waves it'll come naturally.

   Travel within Belize is safe, fast, and reliable.
  Planes and buses transport passengers throughout the country daily and a number of agencies have vehicles available for rent.
  Details regarding these travel options throughout Belize are outlined below.
  The most time efficient option for travel within Belize is by plane.
  Regularly scheduled flights cover the country and provide passengers with a vantage point that leaves many wishing that the fight times were not so quick.
  The least expensive way to get around Belize on a day to day basis is by bus.
 As buses are the primary mode of transportation for most Belizeans, routes run on regular schedules and will stop to pick up or drop off passengers at most any location along the way.
     Every bus operates with a driver and a conductor.
  Luggage and bags are handled by the conductor.
  He or she will also come to passengers while the bus is in transit to collect the fare.
  As bus tationsmove about and schedules shift slightly through the year, visitors will find these logistical details answered most accurately by any taxi driver or most any person on the street.
Belize City and Belmopan serve as the central hubs for bus transportation.
 While buses travel to and from each town and district several times daily, many of the more remote villages see only one bus out and one bus in each day.
  Many locations within Belize cannot be accessed without the use of a private vehicle.
  Whether in a taxi, tour van, or in a personal rental, the freedom of four wheels will add significantly to what visitors are able to see while traveling Belize.
  Provided below is a listing of the various rental agencies throughout the country.

org - official site of the Belize Tourism Board             
      With 174 miles of protected coastline, Belize is the perfect place to enjoy the cutting-edge water sports of windsurfing, parasailing, kiteboarding, jet skiing, and aqua biking.
 Belize is at the forefront of the latest trends as new action sports appear on the scene.
         For water enthusiasts, the Cayes have it all.
 Flat water created by           the reef and the constant onshore/side-shore winds that provide an ideal           location for the beginner to try a first lesson or take a course.
 For           the intermediate, the conditions enable the excitement of blasting and           chop hopping.
 Runs of 10 miles plus are possible on either tack; perfect           for practicing waterstarts and carve gybes.
 The water below is so clear           that you can see fish and stingrays and it is not unusual to see dolphins           as you pass.
 For more experienced windsurfers, there are several wave           sites, and of course, access to the swells of the big blue.
         Clear waters average a comfortable 75 to 84  while favorable winds blow February through June.
 During these months the trade winds run at 12 to 20 knots and above, 70 % of the time.
 Throughout the rest of the year, expect winds around 6 knots.
 The mean annual temperature of Belize is 80 .
For the safety and wellbeing of all, it is required that any organization that operates a water passenger vessel or a local water sports vessel must obtain a license to operate.

                  Overlooking the Mopan River, the Maya Site of Xunantunich is locatedapproximately eight miles west of San Ignacio Town at San Jose SuccotzVillage in the Cayo District.
  Xunantunich is accessible by publictransportation, but after crossing the Mopan River by way of a hand-cranked ferry, you mustwalk about one mile to the entrance of the site.
  By  using a travel or 
tour operator, you will be ferried across with their vehicle, thuseliminating the walk.
Xunantunich was a major ceremonial center during the Classic Period.
  Thesite is composed of six major plazas and surrounded by more than twenty-fivetemples and palaces.
  The most prominent structure located at the south endof the site is the pyramid "El Castillo" (The Castle) which rises 130 feet highabove the plaza.
 "El Castillo" was the tallest man-made structure in allof Belize until the discovery of "Canaa" at  
  The most notablefeature on "El Castillo" is the reconstructed frieze on the east side ofthe lower temple.
Currently, additional explorations and excavations are being performed byDr.
 Richard Leventhal and the Institute of Archaeology in an effort tobetter understand the history of Xunantunich.

        The Belize Zoo was founded in 1983 as a retirement home for natural history "movie stars.
" It has since become a refuge and rehabilitation center for injured wildlife, as well as a home for abused and abandoned "pets.
" Because there are healthy populations of certain species of wildlife in Belize, it is easy (though also illegal) for people to acquire birds and animals which they attempt to domesticate for their own personal pleasure.
 People are most often unable to tame these animals, or they grow tired of their "pets.
" The Belize Zoo has played a major role in saving the lives of these animals by providing a new home for these orphans who are most often unable to return to their natural home in the wild.
Whenever possible, all wildlife that can be rehabilitated and are considered able to survive in the wild are reintroduced to their natural environment.
 Those animals that cannot be reintroduced to their environment are maintained in a natural setting at the zoo, where they become an integral part of an ongoing program to educate people about the natural history of Belize.
Want to improve your natural history experience?
 Be sure to make the Belize Zoo one of your first stops.
 Learn what the indigenous birds and animals of Belize look like and how to spot them in their natural habitat.
  The Zoo is located 29 1/2 miles west of Belize City on the Western Highway, and is open daily--except on Good Friday and Christmas Day--from 9:30 A.
 The nominal admission fee of US$5.
00 is used to support the facility and all of the associated education programs.

 Her Kind | 100 Best Poems   
html   "I have gone out, a possessed witch, haunting the black air, braver at night; dreaming evil, I have done my hitch over the plain houses, light by light: lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.
 A woman like that is not a woman, quite.
 I have been her kind.
  I have found the warm caves in the woods, filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves, closets, silks, innumerable goods; fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves: whining, rearranging the disaligned.
 A woman like that is misunderstood.
 I have been her kind.
  I have ridden in your cart, driver, waved my nude arms at villages going by, learning the last bright routes, survivor where your flames still bite my thigh and my ribs crack where your wheels wind.
 A woman like that is not ashamed to die.
 I have been her kind.

 Morning Song by Sylvia Plath   
   Love set you going like a fat gold watch.
 The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry Took its place among the elements.
  Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival.
 In a drafty museum, your nakedness Shadows our safety.
 We stand round blankly as walls.
  I'm no more your mother Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow Effacement at the wind's hand.
  All night your moth-breath Flickers among the flat pink roses.
 I wake to listen: A far sea moves in my ear.
  One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral In my Victorian nightgown.
 Your mouth opens clean as a cat's.
 The window square  Whitens and swallows its dull stars.
 And now you try Your handful of notes; The clear vowels rise like balloons.

   "An untold number of college-age women find themselves in Lopez's position for real, because their colleges regularly refer students to CPCs (crisis pregnancy centers).
 A survey conducted this past summer by the Feminist Majority Foundation, publisher of Ms.
, found that of 398 campus health centers at four-year colleges that responded to a questionnaire, 48 percent routinely refer women who think they might be pregnant to CPCs.
 Although 81 percent also refer women to full-service health clinics, some campus centers say they want to give students eall of the options, as one health-center director put it.
  But the ramifications to women health and reproductive rights couldn't be more serious.
 "Any attempt to delay care and try and scare a woman into keeping an unwanted pregnancy only serves to put her at higher riskespecially if she has an ectopic pregnancy,"says Beth Jordan, M.
, an internist who is the medical director of the Feminist Majority Foundation.
 "As a doctor, it's shocking to me that health centers at academic institutions would refer women to these CPCs that blatantly misinform women of health risks in an attempt to scare them into keeping the pregnancy.

 however, here i have some thoughts on this as well:  *if you actually know me from outside of the world of Stumble Upon, OR if we've had a consistent back-and-forth, i will most certainly add you as a friend.
  *if you happened to stumble through and liked what you found, rather than adding me as a friend, please subscribe, write a review, or give me a thumbs up.
 i'll do my best to pay you a return visit and do the same.

 In Italy, Feminism Out, Women As Sex Symbols In : NPR   
   "The Berlusconi TV model is widely seen as having shaped Italy's contemporary society, and journalist Lilli Gruber says feminism and solidarity among women are out of fashion.
  A former TV anchorwoman who resigned from public television in protest over Berlusconi's control of the media, Gruber says most women appear unwilling or unable to assert themselves and too weak to fight.
  She points out, however, that the majority of Italians now studying in universities are women -- a generation that she believes won't be passive and might even succeed in breaking down Italy's old-boy network.

 Her Kind | 100 Best Poems   
html   "I have gone out, a possessed witch, haunting the black air, braver at night; dreaming evil, I have done my hitch over the plain houses, light by light: lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.
 A woman like that is not a woman, quite.
 I have been her kind.
  I have found the warm caves in the woods, filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves, closets, silks, innumerable goods; fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves: whining, rearranging the disaligned.
 A woman like that is misunderstood.
 I have been her kind.
  I have ridden in your cart, driver, waved my nude arms at villages going by, learning the last bright routes, survivor where your flames still bite my thigh and my ribs crack where your wheels wind.
 A woman like that is not ashamed to die.
 I have been her kind.

         &quot;How this amazing  little          secret -    that    took just MINUTES to add to my web site -  increased sales    152% and won 76% MORE subscribers.
 in less than 24 hours!
&quot;*                    Warning:  If          you are still using the same tiresome popups on your web site,  YOU          MAY BE LOSING BIG MONEY.
          When I discovered this mistake and replaced my old          popups with this powerful new unstoppable popup system, my sales increased          152% - and          76% MORE people subscribed to my eCourse.
 all in less than 24 hours.
*          If I was still using my old popup system, I would have          lost a lot of sales in 2004.
 Don't let this happen to you.
          * The testimonials, examples, and cases used are        outstanding results, which do not apply to the average purchaser and        user, and are not intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will        achieve identical or similar results.
 Each individual's success depends        on his background, enthusiasm, desire, dedication, and motivation.
Outremont, QC, CanadaH2V 3V3Dear Internet Friend, I have been doing and using them for quite a while now, and a  very select group of marketers has also been profiting from this strategy.
  It has been criticized and disregarded by the average e-business owner.
 It&rsquo;s a fact, popups ARE an extremely    powerful tool for instantly increase your sales and dramatically    boost the number of subscribers to your courses or newsletters.
(And it's not my fault they are so successful, so &#8212;please&#8212;  don't send me angry emails complaining about it.
 ) How do I know popups work?
 Because:   Just ONE of my Focus popup promotions that appears on a few of my web pages  created      an extra $3,727 in profits last year.
*           Until recently, just ONE of my popups has been responsible for  adding      an extra 400 new subscribers* to my opt-in list every single      month.
 And the crazy thing is, I haven't changed the content in these popups  in over three years!
 They've both just keep on working and working, and I've  been too busy working on other things to worry about them.
               Case studies*          &quot;Personally I HATE POP UPS!
 But based on my tests, they increase my sign          ups by 57%.
com        &nbsp;        &quot;It's a Marketer's dream tool.
&quot;         &quot;When we first created our web site,                we were averaging about 10 to 15 subscribers a day.
 We needed            a way to increase this number, so after some research on how            other sites increased their lists quickly, we            soon found out that all the sites we believed were making good money            at the time had one thing in common: They all had popups.
com         &nbsp;        &quot;Increased our sales by $300 - $500 per day, and was one          of the smartest moves we ever made.
com     * The testimonials, examples, and cases used are outstanding        results, which do not apply to the average purchaser and user, and are not        intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve identical or        similar results.
 Each individual's success depends on his background, enthusiasm,        desire, dedication, and motivation.
And I've seen it myself, when used &#8212;properly&#8212;, popups    can have a very positive and profitable impact on the growth of your business.
  *Earnings    Disclaimer How you can profit from my stupid mistake.
Remember how I told you that, until a few months ago, just ONE of my popups  has been responsible for adding an extra 400 new subscribers to my opt-in list  every single month.
 And how just ONE of my popup promotions that appears  on only four of my web pages generated an extra $3,727 in profits last year?*Well, it's true.
 I do &#8212;get&#8212; these kinds of  results.
However, while the sales and opt-ins have remained very  consistent from these popups over the last year, my conversion rates on them  have been slowly going down.
 My web site traffic increased, but my sales and opt-ins stayed the  same.
 And I&nbsp;didn't notice because I was only looking at TOTAL subscribers  and TOTAL sales.
And when you know that I sell regular popup software.
At first, I wasn't afraid that pop-up &quot;blocker&quot; software would harm  my sales.
 After all, this type of software could actually have a negative  effect on your  surfing experience.
 ( Pop-up blocker software blocks stuff you WANT to see like  regular popups where you enter information like usernames and passwords, or  permits you to see &quot;bigger&quot; images  of thumbnail photos.
 and a lot more.
) And second, I knew that many of these &quot;free&quot; popup blockers come  packed with dangerous &quot;spyware&quot; that  people typically do NOT want on their computers.
And then things started to change.
The &quot;Big Guys&quot; like Google, Netscape,    and AOL were    kidnapping my customers and subscribers!
 have all released  their own FREE versions of &quot;pop-up blocker&quot; software included  in their FREE toolbars.
With these,     the average person has no idea that they are installing &quot;pop-up    blockers&quot; when    they  download the toolbars and browsers offered by these web giants.
Did you know that when the average person installs the Google Toolbar, for  example, they have NO IDEA that the &quot;popup blocker&quot; is  already switched on?Finally,  Microsoft decided to  put a &quot;pop-up blocker&quot; in Windows XP.
 This made me mad!
  I certainly wasn't going to sit around and let  Microsoft, Google or AOL dictate how I present my web pages to my  customers and subscribers!
 So I invested my time in a popup system that's been carefully  designed to  PROTECT your subscriptions and sales  from the popup blockers!
How does this popup system actually work?I won't get into all of the technical explanations.
 But basically, it works  by making your popup &quot;float&quot; in the same window as your regular web  page, instead of making it appear in an entirely new window like regular popups!
  The popup blockers  &#8212;even Microsoft&rsquo;s&#8212; have  NO      WAY of knowing a popup is even there because, to them, there is      NO POPUP.
 Your web page is a regular web page!
)   Obviously, this &quot;Unstoppable Popup Technology&quot; is extremely effective,  and I was really excited when I first heard about it.
 But&hellip; the web sites  that were selling this specialized popup software were charging an arm and  a leg for it&hellip; Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m a programmer, so I made mine!
 And I decided to make  it affordable too!
 And I made it with even more advanced capabilities.
  Choose from  THREE unique unblockable popup   styles  that slide in &#8212;or not&#8212; to instantly   GRAB your visitors' attention!
 The Unstoppable Popup Creator software gives you the power to create ads that  are far more appealing than the typical boring popups you see on every other  web site.
   For example, imagine having an unblockable popup that  suddenly &quot;drops&quot; down      from the top of your browser window before coming to a stop in the middle    of your screen!
Wouldn't that grab your visitor&rsquo;s attention?It sure grabs mine!
 And I know from tests that this &quot;Drop&quot; unblockable  popup ad has been working like mad.
 Subscriptions skyrocketed  66% during the first 24 hours* I tested this unstoppable ad, and they've continued to steadily  climb ever since.
And this is JUST one of the  three unstoppable popup window    styles you'll be  able to choose from with Unstoppable Popup Creator.
 You'll also be able to  create ads using:&nbsp;             1.
 This popup &quot;looks&quot; like          a regular popup window, but it actually includes the ability to be &quot;dragged&quot;, making        it easy to read and move.
       This popup can be centered or be          positionned where you want it on the web page.
 You can modify the color of the title bar and        the text and color of the text in the title bar.
        The content can be what you want: pictures, text, even        forms.
 Click here for an example.
  T   he &quot;No          Title Bar&quot; Unstoppable          popup window Ad.
 This popup has no title bar.
 You have complete          control over it's look!
       You have  seven border types to        choose from and all the web colors can be applied to them!
 Like the Classic        popup, it can be centered or be positionned where you want it on the        web page.
       The content can be what you want: pictures, text,          even forms.

 No matter whether you're an Internet beginner or an e-commerce expert,  publishing eye-catching, professional popups is surprisingly simple with the  untopppable popup creator.
In fact, the first step you'll take is choosing WHICH of these three wizards  you'd like to use!
 With these tools you'll have.
   The potential to increase YOUR    subscriptions and profits at EVERY stage of your sales process.
   from first visit to repeat visitors and purchases!
Most business don't realize that there is more than ONE way to use unblockable  popups to increase your subscriptions and sales.
 The truth is, any offer or  presentation you can dream up for your web site can typically be put in a unstoppable  popup and tested for an even BIGGER impact!
 For example, you can.
   Collect up to FIVE times more opt-in e-mail addresses with &quot;subscribe now&quot; or &quot;sign    up&quot; popup offers, then use strategic follow-up e-mails to establish    your credibility, build more value, and close the sale!
      Learn how to sell MORE product to the same visitors by finding out what    your key obstacles to selling MORE are.
 Is your price too    high?
 Did they misinterpret your offer?
 Was the benefit not clear enough?    Use &quot;unstoppable      popup surveys&quot; to get this critical information from your customers!
      Surprise your visitors with &quot;crazy gift        offers&quot; that give them    a special discount or purchase bonus on the product of YOUR choice.
     Want to      blowout some extra stock? Sales low on a particular item?
 This can be a    great &quot;quick tool&quot; for      your sales!
      Ask visitors if they'd like to &quot;bookmark        this page&quot; and watch    your traffic instantly double as one-time visitors become REPEAT visitors.
 and this is only a small fraction of the ways you can use popups to increase  your profits and sales.
You don't need to know a THING about JavaScript programming.
 All you have  to do is click on a few check boxes, and the Unstoppable Popup Creator Wizards  do the rest.
 They make all the code for you.
 All you have to do is copy and  paste.
                    &nbsp;       Step #1:        Choose the            style of the unstoppable popup you want to create: Classic            popup, No-Title Bar popup, or Image-Link popup (also known a Focus            generator).
 If it&rsquo;s            the Classic, you will go through the following steps&hellip;        &nbsp;              &nbsp;      Step #2:        Decide what width your            popup will be and where your popup will &quot;appear&quot; on the viewer's screen (or just let the        wizard center it for you).
&nbsp;             &nbsp;      Step #3:       Choose the &quot;title&quot; for            your popup, which        will appear in the title bar (at the very top of the popup),  decide        what color you want the title bar and text to be!
 This never takes me more than a few seconds to decide!
&nbsp;             &nbsp;      Step #4:      Decide what color you want for          the popup border, the width of the border and the style (solid, dotted, dashed, double, grooved,        ridge, inset or outset).
 I just love to play with those settings!
&nbsp;             &nbsp;      Step #5:       Choose if you will make your          popup slide from the        left, from the top or just &ldquo;appear&rdquo; without sliding in.
&nbsp;             &nbsp;      Step #6:       Add your content (pictures and          text) using the HTML        editor of your choice.
 Or copy &amp; paste content from an &ldquo;existing&rdquo; popup        that you'd like to replace with an unstoppable one!
&nbsp;                   &nbsp;      Step #7:      Add the finishing touches.
           Unstoppable Popup Creator&rsquo;s Cookie based popups allows you to           Control how many times a visitor will see your          popup:              Only Once per            session: Your visitor will only see the popup once          while they keep the same browser open.
 If they close the browser, and          later revisit your site, they will see the popup again.
 This is a useful          setting to avoid annoying your visitors while maximizing the benefit          of the popup to your business.
        Only Once in a lifetime.
         Now, and then Repeat after x days              (1,          2, 3 or more days, you decide).
                       &nbsp;      Step #8:      Decide if you want to  set          a Delayed entrance popup (the      popup will appear only after x seconds)  .

      Sometimes I envy people.
      I guess it's embarrassing to tell you that.
      Here&#8217;s        why:        I have programmed so many popup trigger pages that I can&#8217;t possibly        count them all!

       I looked all over the Internet, searched and searched.
 and I couldn&#8217;t        find         a better way.
 Sure, I found a few sites that gave a JavaScript trick        or        two,         a        few more sites that sold JavaScript popup generator software (at outrageous        prices).
 I made      the software!

       &nbsp;        What are JavaScript Popup Windows?      For the uninitiated, a popup refers to a secondary, usually smaller        window that loads on top of the main window, and contains a separate        HTML document inside of it.
       JavaScript popup windows are web pages, the exact same type of web pages        that we find all over the Internet, but with one slight difference: when        a popup window creation is done through JavaScript, you can control the        look and feel of the new window.
      &nbsp;        With JavaScript you can create   all sorts of popup windows:       &nbsp;      First visit JavaScript popup      A First visit popup is a JavaScript popup window that shows up only        once.
      There are 3 types of First visit popups:       
   Only          once in a lifetime - after it's first pop, the popup will          never &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reappear, or only after xxx visits or days.
   Only          once every x days - after it's first pop, the popup will show          up &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after a fixed amount of days (1, 2, 3 or more).
            Exit popup or On Unload popup       
   An        exit popup is a popup that is created only when the visitor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changes from one web page to another - i.
 he leaves the main &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;web page for another page (on your site or another site).
   A        delayed popup is a popup that loads after x amount of time.
            Standard popup or Link popup       
   A        Javascript link popup is a popup window that is created when the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visitor clicks on a link.
   A        JavaScript Image link popup is a popup window that is created &nbsp;         when the        visitor clicks on an image.
   A        button popup, or form button popup is a popup window that is created &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the visitor clicks on a button.
   An        onload popup is a popup window that is created automatically &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the visitor comes to the main web page.
            Text on mouse over popup       
   A        text on mouse over popup is a popup window that is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;created when the visitor moves his mouse over a text link.
            JavaScript image on mouse over popup       
   An        Image on mouse over popup is a popup window that is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;created when the visitor moves his mouse over an image.
) without          closing the main window.
                  Generally speaking, popup windows are used to build your potential customer      list or to show something special while keeping the main window open.
       JavaScript can be totally complicated         and for those of you who are        new to web authoring,         these scripts can be very frightening.
         So what      does the typical person do?
        He  simply doesn&#8217;t      use popups.
      &nbsp;        Many people like you         will         encounter       these problems when using popups:               You don&#8217;t know where to place the JavaScript popup code.
           Poor        instructions can make your utilization of popups a horrendous experience.
        A lot of   JavaScript popups don&#8217;t do what you want          them to do!
           Since you know nothing about JavaScript popup code, you          can&#8217;t          correct the code or merge two different JavaScript popups to get the        final result you want.
        Not knowing how to edit the JavaScript popup code can be            very annoying.
             After searching for days, you finally find the script you          desperately want and now            you don&#8217;t know how to edit all this code that looks like a            close encounter of the fourth kind language to you.
 End result, you            don&#8217;t        use it.
                  These problems alone are enough to make anyone mad and want to forget      all about popups.
            You can&#8217;t reject the benefits of popup advertising.
 Popup advertising        can easily increase your income by thousands of dollars if you use it        correctly.
        I am telling you!
   Popups don&#8217;t have to be complicated.
        I personally built this great tool for you:        Popup Creator!

 Fifth Annual Weblog Awards: The 2005 Bloggies    
2009Fifth Annual Weblog Awards: The 2005 Bloggies Where can you find the   most interesting weblogs?
   Which blogs have made their mark this year?
 Who will do   anything for a nomination?
 Those questions will be answered in the   one and only.
 The Bloggies&trade; are a set of 30   publicly-chosen awards given to weblog writers and those related to weblogs.
 This is the   fifth ceremony, with previous winners listed on their respective sites:  
   Everyone's invited to take part in the awarding process, so read below   to find out how you can nominate and vote for your   favorite blogs!
 As you may have noticed, the site's been going down often due to the bandwidth limits I have this year, and at the rate things are going, I'll probably run out of bandwidth again sometime in the next week.
 If you'd like to help out, I encourage you to use a  
PayPal account to contribute a few bucks.
 Note that this link shouldn't be used for prize contributions; those contributors will send the prizes directly to the winners in March.
--   Read the RulesA "weblog" is defined as a page with dated entries.
The contest is open to any weblogs that existed for a period of time during the year 2004, so weblogs that were discontinued during 2004 are also eligible.
Only one nomination form and one finalist voting form may be submitted per person.
E-mail addresses are required to vote.
 You must use your own address.
If you attempt to submit a second ballot, your first one will be erased.
In the nomination phase:URLs are required (where applicable).
The maximum number of weblogs you may nominate for a category is three (3) for most categories and four (4) for Weblog of the Year.
At least three (3) different weblogs total must be nominated.
You may nominate your own weblog, but the total nominations for your own weblog must be less than one third of your total (legitimate) nominations.
There is no limit to the number of categories a weblog may be nominated for.
Nominees have to fit the category they are placed in.
The system alerts me of suspicious ballots, and I also may exclude ballots when I suspect the voter isn't following the rules.
 This means no bots.
These rules may change at any time, but they probably won't.
   Learn About the ProcedureFrom Saturday, January 1, 2005 to Monday, January 10, anyone was able to nominate their favorite weblogs.
On Tuesday, January 18, three panels of 50 voters received an e-mail.
 It listed the weblogs that received the most nominations in ten categories.
 They had until 10:00 PM EST on Saturday, January 22 to privately submit their five favorites (six for Weblog of the Year) for each category.
 The five (or six for Weblog of the Year) receiving the most votes became finalists.
 I (Nikolai Nolan) only voted for the panel in the case of a tie for fifth place.
On Sunday, January 23, the finalists were announced and voting was open again to choose the winners.
Voting closed at 10:00 PM EST on Thursday, February 3.
 The winners were posted on Monday, March 14.
   Come to the CeremonyThe Weblog Awards&trade; ceremony will be held at the  
South by Southwest Interactive Festival for the third time in Austin, Texas, USA on Monday, March 14 at 12:30 PM.
 Webloggers including previous Bloggie&trade; winners and prize contributors will present certificates and prizes to those present.
Those who aren't attending may join the excitement on IRC, in  
 Winners will be announced live and a play-by-play of the ceremony will be given.
After the ceremony, the results will be posted on this page.
   Admire the PrizesBecause of the large amount of categories, I won't personally give a award to every winner, but the Weblog of the Year owner(s) will receive 2,005 US cents (US$20.
Also, contributors can donate their own prizes to the category of their choice, and if the contributor has a site, it will be linked from this page.
 If the contributor is going to SXSW, he/she can also have the privilege of announcing/presenting the category sponsored at the ceremony.
 To donate one, the contributor can bring it to SXSW, mail it to the winner, or send an online gift certificate or cash to the winner.
 Prizes that are more creative than my $20 are encouraged.
e-mail to get your prize added.
 Sorry, "to be announced" prizes to reserve categories won't be accepted this year.
 I'll send out a list of winner's e-mails to the contributors after they're announced, but all other prize arrangements will be handled by their respective donators.
Since I intend for the Weblog Awardsto remain an independently-produced ceremony without corporate sponsorship, starting this year I'd like to restrict the contributor links to individuals, non-profit organizations, or companies that contribute to the blog universe in some way.
South by Southwest Interactive offers Bloggie&trade; finalists a special discount to attend the ceremony in March.
 The cost of Interactive registration for Bloggie&trade; finalists is $175.
The Webby Awards offers Bloggie&trade; finalists free entry in to the Webbys' Blog category.
Lulu will award each Bloggie&trade; winner a book made from their blog entries.
T-Shirt Humor will award each Bloggie&trade; winner a

Gustavo Millon has left the building 
    Photo by Diego Hurtado de MendozaIn Chilean folklore, busquilla is the man who has learned to fight his own way, depending on no one else.
 Earlier this year, when lunches at Ennio were still held outside, that was how a fellow compatriot described Gustavo.
 I thought it fitted him perfectly - both because the word sounded rather humble (an adjective that has always suited Gustavo) and because of his history.
 The first Chilean to step into the Bubble, the photographer from Santiago was told right from the beginning things wouldn't be easy for him (not that things are that easy for any of us, but we are usually well deceived in the beginning!
 One year and a half later, he is back in Santiago and guarantees it was all worth it.
Were you really the first chilean guy at Fabrica?
 How did you get here? Yes, i'm the first chilean in fabrica (what doesn't mean the last one, I hope) I participated in a contest "Wanted Creativity" (yes, wanted creativity) about the environment.
 I sent one project and I won, the prize was the scholarship in Fabrica for one year.
Deciding to come was a difficult or an obvious choice? It was obvius, good opportunity for meet with different persons, be a better photographer and know about Fabrica.
 Also, it was my first time in Europe, in Italy and Treviso.
)What's the best word to describe Fabrica?
 My first roomate (Nobu, japanese) told me that.
 I thought he was exaggerating but I understood later what mean.
 Fabrica is a small bubble what cover us of everything.
 We speak in english (no italian) we stay there for all the day and is diffcult have connections with persons outside of Fabrica, all the day togheter.
 Even when we are outside of Fabrica.
 Sometimes is good, sometimes is.
What was the best life advice you heard here?
  "I will be here if you need to talk with someone" Diego Beyr (is not a advice, but is something what always i will remember)Most memorable moments.
 I can't describe all the great moments what I had in Fabrica, mensa for sure!
 the conversations in the coffee machine!
 but something what I always I will remember is ride in my bicycle in Treviso (something what I will continue doing here)How would you like to be remembered? I don't know.
 Maybe like the guy that smile always.
 ;)Last words? My last words are just have all the fun that you can get in Fabrica, do your personal projects (is the best of Fabrica) and never change, even if someone tell you are wrong, because usually is not like that.
 I want to tell something to all the persons that wrote a poem (this is in five languages because i received like that)(In english) thanks to all, it was a great experience.
 My english is getting better after of this!
 (In portugueis) Eu espero aprender essa lngua bonita e sua cultura (obrigado Brasil e Portugal) (In italian) Mi mancher il capuccino e la brioche per la mattina!
 un abbraccio a tutti (In german) Und am Ende, wir sind zusammen.
 Ich werde Sie vermissen Prinzessin (In spanish) a mi hermosa comunidad hispanohablante que me dio lo mejor de los recuerdos, lo mejor de todo.
) al argentino que llega tarde siempre (pero que trabaja mas que ninguno con una creatividad increble, garca!
 haha) y a mi gran hermano argentino artista que se que va a lograr todo lo que se proponga, siempre.
 Porque si tu  me dijiste que estaras simepre yo tambin lo estar para t (no me olvido por supuesto del gato mas inteligente y hablador del mundo que te cuida) GRACIAS A TODOSPD: all, all of them are pirates;)www.

Cosimo has left the bunker 
   Our wise and wonderful nonno has left us, and we miss him terribly.
 Our only comfort is in knowing that he has gone to a more peaceful place.
 Before his passing, he wrote this message: Dear Kids, After three long years I've finally left the bunker, like all grandpas sooner or later do.
 It's been good, extremely intense and sometimes difficult.
While I'm away, you guys take care of the grandma and more than anything of each other.
 Be good and respectful but let those who live at the bunker's top floors conspire, panic and argue with each other, without getting involved.
 Speak with Maurizio and with the guys from the portineria, instead.
As for me, I will finally set up my own business, a wedding cake one as you can see from the photo above.

Catarina Carreiras has entered the building 
   Meet Catarina, one of the elusive hard-working contingent of Portugese designers.
 If you feel a strange gravitational force that pulls you into her world - don't resist.
  How did you come to learn about Fabrica? Hum.
 I remember that since I was around 10 years old, everytime I went with my mother to Benetton I would look amazed through every Colors magazine displayed.
  Then a few years later I learned about Tibor Kalman, Toscani, and finally Fabrica.
 Since then I kept wishing that one day I would have the oportunitty to work here.
 And, thanks to the Design Department, here I am.
What have you been doing before now? I was studying Communication Design in Lisbon, doing some freelance work, and trying to travel around as much as I could.
What do you expect to get out of this experience? Lots of "no's", lots of "yessss's", lots of "well done!
" and lots of "no way!
 Basically: lots of work.
What will you miss from home? The sea.
 And everything and everyone around it.
Anything else you'd like to share with us? Yes, nice to meet you all.

Salute to Krol de Rueda 
   Krol, Fabrica's adored and esteemed writer (and this blog's darling), slipped out of the building last spring in the kind of impassioned, mysterious way typical of this mexican enigma.
 She continued writing for Fabrica from an undisclosed location on the great American continent.
 Recently, I persuaded her to write about her own experience here.
this is what she had to say:What was life like before Fabrica? As usual, surprising and unpredictable.
   I was freelancing graphic design in both Mexico and the US, as well as editing and writing about life and its mysterious ways.
 I was also learning, besides English, that life is way too short to stay still intimidated by your ideas and dreams.
 What was life like at Fabrica? Contradictory; painful, heartbreaking, frustrating, disappointing, but also fascinating, exhilarating, enriching, glorious.
 Life at Fabrica was full of that rare passion that turns the boredom of a customary life into the magical, the utopian and the extraordinary.
  Did you learn anything during your time here? In fact, everyday was a learning experience.
 I learned about Italian culture, falling in love with it.
 I learned about diversity, about fascinating cultures and recondite places, about sounds, ways of life and certainly about food.
  And at the end, in a place that deliberately denies the worries of adulthood and offers you a unique mental freedom that undresses your true personality, I realized how much I learned about myself.
 But I will never forget that beautiful three days birthday party (especially the Gargantua day!
), also night talking with Julia and Nam, balcony sun enjoying with Lizy, dance awakening with Mike and Nic, eat traveling with Anto, canal walking alone.
 Dinners with Christianitos parents, hot arguments with Nobu, ichating with Paolo, brujeando with Cosimo.
 Beer with fries after football, cooking for everyone, the gelato nights, dinners in Venice, Italian cover bands (especially Guns n Roses!
 And of course the bike rides, especially those when the city was sleeping.
 What a beautiful and peaceful place!
 Most memorable people? This is truly the best of Fabrica.
 The beautiful kiwi; the most wonderful and greater listener.
 And of course the formaggio ladies, who not matter what, where there for me five days a week.
 I am taking all of them home with me.
 Worst moments? Even that is contradictory at Fabrica, because when you leave, you miss the pain of the bad days, but at the same time, you suffer thinking about the old wonderful times.
What advice would you have wanted before coming here? Create without permission, collaborate with as many people as you can, share and find support to realize your projects, and dont fall in love with inexpensive good wine; is a deeply painful break up.
  Keep freelancing, keep learning, keep moving, keep dancing, keep listening.
 Any parting words? Lets start getting ready for the First Former Fabricanti Reunion (definitely!
) and of course, an enormous thanks to Mr Benetton, who believes in diversity, freedom and multiculturalism in the name of creativity.
 Krol, keep us posted.

Is pubic hair in inverse proportion to a countrys wealth?It seems that being against (the) Bush is not trendy anymore.
Hi, Im a little confused right now as I read that the current economical and political situation is so much affecting our pubic hair style,  but there seem to be two opposite directions.
 On one hand it seems that because of the recession women are more and more abandoning the Brazilian and  growing a little hair down there .
 Money is tight and maintaining a stripper worthy  wax is not cheap at all.
 So Bush is back, at least down there, according to Lisa Germinsky

 Ask him about Kanye and Method Man, and he will not fail to fill you in.
 Oh, and by the way: he's also an amazing interactive designer, too!
How did you come to learn about Fabrica? I followed the projects of fabrica for the last years and always had the idea to go there after graduating.
What have you been doing before now? I was graduating from University in summer 2008 then I did some freelance design jobs and came to fabrica.
What do you expect to get out of this experience? I am looking forward to work with people from different areas and backgrounds.
 And I want to improve my skills in physical computing and developing concepts.
What will you miss from home? My Girlfriend, Maultaschen and understanding the bus driver.

   "I will show you mine if you show me yours" A special message, I considered, displayed on my Ichat this afternoon.
 Although, only minutes later, the magic was sucked out of this message with; "sorry, I meant that I will only show you my website if you show me your website.
moving on to what today is really about: As is customary at Fabrica, every thursday at 6.
30pm a resident or a trial student shows their work.
 All Fabricantes gather into the cinema, and with few glitches and twitches (always), a grandisimo presentation is made (always!
 Last Thursday,  22 year old Gonalo Campos, recently graduated from  FBAUL- the Fine Arte Faculty of Lisbon University in  Portugal  where he has been majoring in Product Design for the last five years, showed some of his recent work.
  A look at his presentation is a look into his beautiful, minimalist-yet-with-an-eye for detail, and reassuring personality.

 To note: the book shows Alex as a more complex character (capable of real transformation too!
) than the film ever made him out to be.
From Anthony Burgess:  "I am glad, gentlemen, this question of Love has been   raised.
 Now we shall see in action a manner of Love that was   thought to be dead with the Middle Ages.
" And then the lights   went down and the spotlights came on again, one on your   poor and suffering Friend and Narrator, and into the other   there like rolled or sidled the most lovely young devotchka   you could ever hope in all your jeezny, O my brothers, to   viddy.
 That is to say, she had real horrorshow groodies all of   which you could like viddy, she having on platties which came   down down down off her pletchoes.
 And her nogas were like   Bog in His Heaven, and she walked like to make you groan in   your keeshkas, and yet her litso was a sweet smiling young   like innocent litso.
 So I creeched out:   "O most beautiful and beauteous of devotchkas, I throw   like my heart at your feet for you to like trample all over.
 If I   had a rose I would give it to you.
 If it was all rainy and cally   now on the ground you could have my platties to walk on so   as not to cover your dainty nogas with filth and cal.
" And as I   was saying all this, O my brothers, I could feel the sickness   like slinking back.
 "Let me," I creeched out, "worship you and   be like your helper and protector from the wicked like world.
"   Then I thought of the right slovo and felt better for it, saying:   "Let me be like your true knight," and down I went again on   the old knees, bowing and like scraping.
   And then I felt real shooty and dim, it having been like an   act again, for this devotchka smiled and bowed to the audi-   ence and like danced off, the lights coming up to a bit of  applause.
 And the glazzies of some of these starry vecks in the   audience were like popping out at this young devotchka with   dirty and like unholy desire, O my brothers.

    (This is not Hamlet!
 Lets read and find out!
)You can hate it, you can love it.
 But one thing is certain: Facebook is getting more and more popular every day.
 Even the most stupid person becomes confident with the social network in few steps.
 THIS MUST MEAN SOMETHING.
Forget all its dangerous social implications for a while (I.
 "Have the people become unable to have genuine relations in their real life?", "Is Facebook just a way to be lazy at work?", " Does it create dependence?" Etc.
) and let them to the thousands of psychologists,  anthropologists  and priests (!
) who are already spending thier nights to solve the question.
The most authoritative Italian newspaper on Economics has dedicated its weekly special magazine to the phenomenon, trying to find out and explain the reasons of its success.
This made me realize, once again, that Communication, in all its forms, has no limits.
 Communication, in all its forms, is not "good" or "bad" : It depends on how you use it.
The means in itself is just a means.
 When it becomes a purpose, the problems start.
 On the other hand - and at the same time - the people (i.
 our "friends on Facebook) must always been considered "as an end and never merely as a means to an end".

the disappearance of pownce and other social networking sites 
 I signed up a year ago, and it was fun for a week, but none of my friends were using it.
 Maybe a couple, but not enough.
 It had a slick interface, you could share music files in posts, and seemed like it could be fun, but the web doesn't exist without your virtual friends.
 With the downturn of the economy, smaller social networking sites like these are shutting down, but Facebook will remain strong because its been around for a awhile and people have gotten used to it.
 Once people get attached to some social networking service by virtue of its sustained existence, it doesn't die easily.
 By now, virtually ALL of my contacts are in Facebook, and it functions as a durable address book that.
 I can't live without.

 A social network around the notion of energy use and conservation.
A new, free digital application that allows us to understand our real energy footprint.
 Because solving climate and energy challenges requires everyone's help.
Carbon footprint, climate change problems, ecological disaster, we're all aware of this, but what do you do when it comes to such questions as: "how do I fit in?
 what is my role in this?" These guys have set up a wiki methodology for assembling a complex dataset, then translated into a web tool,  a rich online audit   
 It helps users understand their personal impact on the environment and how they rate compared to others WattzOn users, as well as global averages.
  We know one of the biggest causes of ecological damages is flying, but then of course everything else we do, from driving, powering a home, eating, shopping, working and even ones share of the energy necessary to make our society function.
 How much power do we use in our lives? Curiosity: the top 4 countries in the world, Usa, Usrr, China and Germany have put more than half of the carbon dioxide ever put into the athmosphere since the industrial revolution.

Marta Teixeira da Silva has left the building 
   Before the hordes of Portuguese came in, there was Marta Teixeira da Silva.
 The wisest of us all, Marta distributed her inspiring words with the same elegance anywhere - from a cigarette break outside the Design Department to a big shot presentation at the Peggy Guggenheim in Venice.
 Back in her homeland, she announces: Lisboa continua muito boa!
 What was life like before Fabrica? I was in sunny Lisbon, working in Fabrica Features Lisboa, working together with Cristina Dias with whom I was also working in other projects - making special edition CD Packgings, all silk screen printed and hand made.
 What was life like at Fabrica? It was a great year.
 Had the chance to be part of some great projects, met a lot of beautiful and talented people, learned some italian and spanish and french, and even improved my portuguese serelepi from brazil.
 Had a lot of friends coming to visit, witch was also very nice.
 Had the honor to experiment some extraordinary recipes and some nice wine.
 It was a great and full year.
Most memorable moments? The memorable moments are always about the people which you share them with.
 But being in there is already a memorable moment.
 It's a very special place, where you have a completely different life than at home with very different people.
 Everything is intense, it's one year but it runs really fast.
 Will never forget some smiles and great moments even if they are stupid things like having a carrot screaming inside your oven.
What is the plan now? Back to Lisbon and enjoying every part of it and every friend.
 It's good to be back and being surprised again by beautiful things in this city that you tend not to forget.
 Working in some great projects and waiting for visits here in Lisbon.
 Have a lot of memorable moments.
Last words? Enjoy that time, be sincere and make the best out of that time in there but dont forget that its also good to go back to reality.

 I've found some really neat stuff that has currently been popping up in the Vimeo community.

 Super interesting and inspiring stuff.

 How did you come to learn about Fabrica? Actually I don't remember.
Maybe I always knew about F a b r i c a.
 When I was seventeen, I guess.
 I saw a conference about graphic communication in Mestre at the cultural center Candiani and there I heard the name F a b r i c a.
but in that period I wasn't interested in graphic design and communication so I forgot that episode.
What have you been doing before now? I spent three years at IUAV, and last year I graduated in Industrial Design, then I worked for a year and now I'm here!
What do you expect to get out of this experience? Have fun!
 Meet new people from all over the world and share new experiences!
 Learn english as best I can, using my little notebook (to note new words!
), and expand my knowledge in the other fields!
What will you miss from home? Maybe nothing, just my piccolina.
I come from a small town near Venice so I can get home almost anytime I want.
Anything else you'd like to share with us? I want to thank all fabricanti and the other people I met here in recent days and Omar for this incredible oppurtunity, I want to suggest to everybody pass near F a b r i c a  to try our MENSA!
and Piero for the photo!

&laquo; Pushkar Nagwekar has entered the building | 
Interview with Sophie ThomasOver the past ten years, as director and joint owner of  
matthews London, award-winning communication designer Sophie Thomas has led and delivered a vast array of projects across the world.
 These range from the highly acclaimed No Shop campaign for Friends of the Earth in 1997 to the 15 million interactive Space galleries for the Royal Observatory Greenwich which opened this Spring.
  Throughout the years of experience in the communication design industry, Sophie has strived to practice a number of core principles making sure they are instilled in those that work with thomas.
 These include working to a set of highly ethical and sustainable principles and bringing elements of humour and innovation into all the work.
matthews is a successful communication design agency established in 1997 that believes in good design and sustainability.
 As a graphic designer, what motivated you to take such direction? I have always said that as a designer, this is something that I have been always passionate about.
 I was pretty much the way I was brought up: to be quite political, very vocal about my opinions and to understand and have the knowledge about them.
 When I was doing my degree, that wasnt part of my agenda so much.
 It became much more part of my agenda when I went to college to do my MA and I spent two years thinking about what I really wanted to do with my skill set.
 Then I started collaborating with Kristine Mathews.
  We found out that because of our complementary skills and our very similar life agendas, we could do something really powerful.
 Then, our work and lives started to enforce sustainability.
 You have now ten years working with this sustainable philosophy.
 How hard was at the beginning to deal with clients and the new idea of creating green design.
 How difficult is to re-educate them?
  For the beginning, the clients that Kristine and I wanted to work with were very much focused on sustainability, so, the first few projects that we did were very much based on who they were.
 As we started to grow with the practice, we came up with certain rules about our work like using post consumer papers, talking to our printers about how they use their processes, thinking about alternative materials as well.
 Those things became part of the way that we work.
    But because we set the agenda in the first place with projects such as No Shop, or What comes around goes around, the clients came by themselves.
 So its much easier for us to persuade our clients, to talk and to re-educate them.
 We find an incredible variety of materials and different technologies out there, but they are not necessarily pro-ecology.
 Is this, in any way, a limitation for a sustainable designer? I never have seeing that as a limitation.
 It has never limited our work in any way.
 What it does do is that it makes you think more naturally, more creatively about the solutions you want to present to the client.
 Also, designers become responsible to make suppliers to look for other materials and alternatives.
 The two dont have a line between them, so I go home and yes, I recycle my rubbish, I have a bicycle, I live in a very heat efficient house, but then I dont want to go to work and do a very unsustainable practice.
 The two are connected, but you have to understand your limitations.
 Some things you dont have the control over but there are other things you can do like putting pressure by writing a letter to your government.
 Its about levels of degrees and the fact that we all are humans as well.
 Its hard though, we get a lot of criticism, but thomas matthews is very open about discussion so at least we can voice our argument.
A public voice that preaches about a cause needs to follow it.
 Its a big commitment because you represent an image.
  There are people who are incredible sustainable in their lifestyle.
 I try to be that.
 I am not incredible sustainable.
   Is it important to create a sustainable culture, for example, in schools? Its incredible important because the future generations of design I see them as social agents of change.
 Graphic designers have to realize this responsibility.
 If they dont, or if they dont understand it, they cant change the way they work.
 People also have to understand that they need personal lifestyle decisions, what they want to fight for and what not.
 For me, sustainability is such a crucial issue and climate change is everybodys problem; we have to start changing our patterns, the way that we do things.
 We all have to make radical changes to the way that we work, people and designers.
 Designers and all professionals need to find a different way to work without the old wasteful technologies.
  I can only speak for communication design as an individual because this is my area of knowledge, but yes, everything, everybody has something they should change and they need to develop.
 New partnerships and collaborations need to be set up between chemist and philosophers and biologist and carmakers, all these people that creates, all the industries, the corporations, the governments.
 All the design industries need to connect and find new solutions.
 Sophie, do you believe in statistics?  It depends where they come from, but I believe in their power.
 When you look at them, for instance, somebody tells you we only have 99 months until the tipping point, your really dont understand, but I believe in the visual communication of that statistic as a vehicle for telling people what is going on.
 They are very useful tools for explaining positions.
 What do you have to say to those young graphic designers that are trying to work sustainable but they also need to make a profit?   I will say that there is not fight between the two.
 If profit is about creating wealth for one person, then there is no connection.
 But if profit is about creating a community of designers or studio where the wealth can be spread out and it makes everyone happy, then I think there is not argument between the two.
 There are not on a balancing scale.
 Our studio has been running for ten year and we dont make massive profits, but we make enough to pass it on to everybody, to support the studio and support the fantastic work that comes out of it.
 We do sustainable design and it pays very well.
 I think if you dont do it as a designer I think you will suffer because it is the future of design.
    You have been around Fabrica for a couple of days now.
  Its really rewarding for me to see how, now as a designer, you can use your choices as your tools.
 Sustainability is getting there, to one of your everyday questions in how you design something and that is fantastic.

Inside outHere is an idea that will make our bill-mail less outrageous.
 Is simple, environmental, creative and completely free my friends.
 By recycling those security envelopes that we constantly get, we can create a really cool stationary to reuse later on.
 Carefully de-construct your envelopes using your fingers, a letter opener or a blade, making sure not to rip the paper.
 Unfold the envelope completely, and flip over so printed side is facing down.
 Re-fold the envelope inside-out along the score lines and apply glue along any seams that overlap.
 To seal the envelopes, we put a little glue along the top edge and tucked it under the main envelope flap for a clean finish.
Here you can also find a flickr set of security envelope patterns.

           Here's a sharp looking papercraft pinhole camera you can download, cut, and build.
 It's a design that was published in a 1979 issue of "ABC mladch techniko a pYrodovdco" ("An ABC of Young Technicians and Natural Scientists") and translated for digital download by the Linatree photo printer and virtual gallery.

How to make your own podcastI was recently asked by some Fabricanti about podcasting, what it is and how to make one.
  So here are a list of online how-tos that show you how to podcast your own music or audio files.
  This post is meant to be a starting point for the beginners, and if you find more resources, please contribute in the comment section.
Podcasting in a nutshell: Podcast is a way to distribute audio and video content using  
  By subscribing to the RSS feed, the users' computer will automatically download new content without the user having to actively go to the website and active search for new content.
  The podcast files are then available for the users to listen (or watch) on their computer when they want, however they want.
  Podcasts are usually updated periodically.
  The easiest way to find podcast channels is to  use the iTunes podcast library.
  How to podcast audio files: 1.
Using Blogger with Feedburner - for the total newbies (free service, super easy to set up, check this out if you don't have your own server)2.
Using Wordpress (if you are already familiar with Wordpress, this is easy as cake)3.
  This is probably the most complicated out of the three, but if you already have an MT powered blog, this plugin makes it handy to add podcast as part of your existing blog.
Video files can also be podcasted using methods 2 and 3 above, and alternatively, here's a free software that lets you set up your own video podcast channel in seconds:

         I was just making one of these when MAKE pal Steve sent this in!
 - "Well, as you may know I like to shoot a timelapse video now and then.
        Seeing that we use a lot of iSights here, maybe this would be helpful for Carlo -- and others :-)

New super-simple DIY synth plans       
 From Ray Wilson, inventor of the  
Soundlab Mini Synth comes the  
 It's a much simpler circuit, which produces surprisingly cool pulsing, bleeping type noises.
 You can hear sound clips  
 It's made with a handful of components, a few pots and switches and a 9v battery.
 There's a very clear schematic, a PCB design and a stripboard layout.
 If anyone is making a PCB for this kit, could you make me one, too?

        "It's nice to have a bit of colour in your house for style reasons, so here are some neat little PCB's that accommodate a mixture of red, green and blue LEDs giving you the option of controlling the colour they emit.
 They are designed to fit into standard MR16 downlighter frames for convenience of mounting.
 Since this page was put up the intensity of common LEDs has risen dramatically and the matching controller project now has extremely sophisticated software that really makes these lights shine.
        Heres a good excuse to let the electrical engineer in you come out to play a little.
 (No degree in engineering required for this project - simply an interest in making cool glowing stuff!

What happened in Pompidou?Almost everyone is back from the Pompidou.
 The noise has returned.
 The stories are starting to spill out .
but not as quickly as they normally do here.
 In fact, I know almost nothing about what happened in Paris  aside from some jumping into rivers.
 I'm trying to piece it together through photos, but it doesn't help much.
 The ones on the FLICKR banner are all so museumy.
Anyhow, here are a few exclusive and choice photos from the official backstage and frontstage Pompidou photograhper, our dear Reed Young.
 I don't know the stories behind them though.
 Please share them here!

    While everybody is in Paris, we - the left over of Fabrica  had our own exhibition yesterday.

   Just in front of the Centre Pompidou you will see a strange and noisy water installation.
 It's called the Strawinski Fountain, created by swiss artist  
Jean Tinguely (1925 - 1991) and his french wife  
 The 16 moving and water spitting units refer to important compositions by  
 Tinguely is known for his mechanical and dark constructions, while Niki creates colorful and female sculptures.
 The Strawinski Fountain in front of the Centre Pompidou is one of their most important works.

Colors Notebook project; however we did not deliver the images.
 Now is your turn to have a sneak peak to the project organized by Colors.
 The notebooks will be at the Centre Pompidou where the visitors to  
FABRICA: Les Yeux Ouverts at the Pompidou Centre will be able to see all of the notebooks there.
 The filming is for a short film that will be presented there, a documentation of the traveling around the world.
 These are a preview of whats to come.

 Day 8So this thing of voting pictures is becoming bigger.
 No it's not only Ashley who's asking for democratic votes, but two more photographers, Olivia and Philipp, are following the example.
 It's actually a very interesting process, because our taste seem to be so different: I've just had a conversation about the selection, with our soccer star  
Yianni Hill (please look at  
), and we were both noticing how tough is hoosing only five opictures to vote out of so many nice shot.
 I've already talk to you about  
Olivia's work and now I had a chance of giving a look to  
Philipp Ebeling's work about Climate.
 The focus of his project his investigating the change of weather and environment as a consequence of human developement.
 To look at this from the best prospective, Pilipp spent few months in the place hat's nowdays the symbol of fast ad disordered developement: China.
 I wish I had some picture of the pictures to show you.
 well, you know you just have to make a move to Paris to see them.

 Day 7I was at the  
Fabrica patio and the conversation about life and death arose.
 This conversation has been a constant in Fabrica lately as the work of  
Ashley Gilbertson is on display in one of the most sociable areas of the building.
 He has asked us to judge is work, to vote for the most striking and powerful images of his project called Death and Birth.
 The conversation was between  
Juan and they had their different take on the images.
Juan just said the pictures are cheesy, better said, a bit cheesy.
 Then he added that the selection process was a good thing.
Pia, on the other hand, said some of the images are very memorable.
 The photo project by  
Ashley will be displayed at  
FABRICA: Les Yeux Ouverts at the Pompidou Centre.
    Voting system for the images.
Juan thought the best image was the one of the large guy with the childs coffin.
 Pia replayed I like the dark one, the one of the profile of a dead guy in his storage box for the morgue.
" I personally like the one of the three generations looking into the hole.
 The best part of Ashleys exercise is that he is creating a buzz of his work.
 The final selection is still to be made and the images are already controversial amongst us.
 It will be a nice show of very contrasting images, as the subject is by itself: Death and Birth.

 Day 6So few months ago the COLORS magazine project for  
FABRICA: Les Yeux Ouverts at the Pompidou Centre begun.
 Many people around the world were given empty copies of the magazine to fill.
 By empty, I mean the cover just had the name and it was all white, ans so was the inside of what is called the  
  So all the copies are back now, filled up with what those people thought is was interesting to write, draw, create.
 After a selection, the best ones will be shown at the Pompidou.
 I've just seen them and they are quite amazing, both because of the great ideas (most of the people who made them are not professionists.
) and of the various places they come from (from Ucrain to Trinidad de Tobago.
 Because, it goes without saying, COLORS is a magazine about the rest of the world.

I was talking today to Daniel Hirschman from the Interactive department and I asked him: whats your favorite installation in the exhibit for the Pompidou (excluding your own department)? Daniel responded without hesitation,  
  My next question was: why?"The dialog between two speakers is only clearly heard from two specific spots in front of the installation.
  These places are at perpendicular to one another and as I view the work, listen to the dialog presented in front of me, I can watch and connect with the person listening to the dialog on the other side.
  While the voice speaks, a projection of the text is presented letter by letter on what looks like the digital character o an LCD.
  The communication by the voices and letters in juxtaposition to the positioning of the two listeners creates an interesting tension (heightened by the difficulty to hear the voices and read the text simultaneously) Fun!

Here at Farbica we often have visitors of different kinds: journalists, experts in communications, parents, courious people.
 The tour is pretty much always the same: people walk into the nice building and check out the stuff we make here, going through the different departments.
 One thing that usually happens is that they go to the photography department and its almost a desert.
 There might be one or two photographers around, hardly more.
 This because they work in the real word, where things happen.
FABRICA: Les Yeux Ouverts at the Pompidou Centre, they have left the building a while ago to work on their project, and they travelled all over the world.
 The six individual projects create a single collective report of the ongoing changes in the world: I SEE.

 Day 3One day closer to Paris.
 I had just opened the text editor to write this diary for the first time when I heard noise and excitment from upstairs.
 Upstairs from Writing Department (where I am actually writing from) means Interactive Department.
 I went upstairs trying to understand what was that about and I found out it's because  
The Tuned Stairs are done.
Tuned Stairs are is something we in writing know quite well because to get them ready hammers, drills, saws  and other noisy tools have been needed.
 And as if that wasn't enough, the stairs themselves are called Tuned, not Silent.
 So the first prototype had mechanic sounds and then they have been changed with metal bells, animal noises, guitar strings, plasrtic bells.
 all trying to find the kind of sound that would have perfectly fit the stairs.
 This means that downstairs we were kind of forced to listen to the non-stop stairs concert&But now they are done in the last version: xylophones sounds& theyre amazing!
 And since I have been about to go crazy for the made-up noises more than once, you can trust my opinion&

 Day 1In a month, Fabrica will have a big show at the Pompidou Centre in Paris.
 This feature will be a sort of diary about the journey from Treviso to Paris.
 This is my first post for the Fabrica Blog, yet I have been a Fabricante for almost a year& never to late to start.
 Now I will tell you the tales of the show, the people involved, the mishaps, the gossip, basically anything I hear about the show and the building of it, I will share.
  This is day one and only the beginning, so today I will explain the contents of the feature.
 Here, I will introduce the projects involved and the people that create them, also my own personal experience with the show, as I am part of one project& you get the point.
Fabrica at Pompidou Centre show will happen in a month and the postings here will be your preview to the show.
 The show will happen and it will be big.
 Yesterday and the day before, I did a couple of interviews for the show.
 I cant really talk about them now, as the project is directed under some sort of secrecy.
 Sometimes I dont even know whats happening the next day.
 I will talk more about the interviews and the project in some days; but now I will tell you about driving through Italy.
 Driving around Tuscany we found an artificial lake, we stopped on the side of the road.
 I had no swimsuit, so I didnt swim but Giuglio (Camera wonder kid) and Greg (project director) did.
 I read a book.
 The whole scenario made me wonder, in my country, Mexico, you never stop at a lake for a quick swim, lakes are polluted and nasty, and here they welcome you with topless sunbathers and clean water.
 After a great afternoon, traffic.
 Longest trip, we ate like trillions of gas station sandwiches, I have to say my favorite is the Buffalino sandwich at Autogrill.
    Thats all for now.

Gustavo Millon has left the building 
    Photo by Diego Hurtado de MendozaIn Chilean folklore, busquilla is the man who has learned to fight his own way, depending on no one else.
 Earlier this year, when lunches at Ennio were still held outside, that was how a fellow compatriot described Gustavo.
 I thought it fitted him perfectly - both because the word sounded rather humble (an adjective that has always suited Gustavo) and because of his history.
 The first Chilean to step into the Bubble, the photographer from Santiago was told right from the beginning things wouldn't be easy for him (not that things are that easy for any of us, but we are usually well deceived in the beginning!
 One year and a half later, he is back in Santiago and guarantees it was all worth it.
Were you really the first chilean guy at Fabrica?
 How did you get here? Yes, i'm the first chilean in fabrica (what doesn't mean the last one, I hope) I participated in a contest "Wanted Creativity" (yes, wanted creativity) about the environment.
 I sent one project and I won, the prize was the scholarship in Fabrica for one year.
Deciding to come was a difficult or an obvious choice? It was obvius, good opportunity for meet with different persons, be a better photographer and know about Fabrica.
 Also, it was my first time in Europe, in Italy and Treviso.
)What's the best word to describe Fabrica?
 My first roomate (Nobu, japanese) told me that.
 I thought he was exaggerating but I understood later what mean.
 Fabrica is a small bubble what cover us of everything.
 We speak in english (no italian) we stay there for all the day and is diffcult have connections with persons outside of Fabrica, all the day togheter.
 Even when we are outside of Fabrica.
 Sometimes is good, sometimes is.
What was the best life advice you heard here?
  "I will be here if you need to talk with someone" Diego Beyr (is not a advice, but is something what always i will remember)Most memorable moments.
 I can't describe all the great moments what I had in Fabrica, mensa for sure!
 the conversations in the coffee machine!
 but something what I always I will remember is ride in my bicycle in Treviso (something what I will continue doing here)How would you like to be remembered? I don't know.
 Maybe like the guy that smile always.
 ;)Last words? My last words are just have all the fun that you can get in Fabrica, do your personal projects (is the best of Fabrica) and never change, even if someone tell you are wrong, because usually is not like that.
 I want to tell something to all the persons that wrote a poem (this is in five languages because i received like that)(In english) thanks to all, it was a great experience.
 My english is getting better after of this!
 (In portugueis) Eu espero aprender essa lngua bonita e sua cultura (obrigado Brasil e Portugal) (In italian) Mi mancher il capuccino e la brioche per la mattina!
 un abbraccio a tutti (In german) Und am Ende, wir sind zusammen.
 Ich werde Sie vermissen Prinzessin (In spanish) a mi hermosa comunidad hispanohablante que me dio lo mejor de los recuerdos, lo mejor de todo.
) al argentino que llega tarde siempre (pero que trabaja mas que ninguno con una creatividad increble, garca!
 haha) y a mi gran hermano argentino artista que se que va a lograr todo lo que se proponga, siempre.

Cosimo has left the bunker 
   Our wise and wonderful nonno has left us, and we miss him terribly.
 Our only comfort is in knowing that he has gone to a more peaceful place.
 Before his passing, he wrote this message: Dear Kids, After three long years I've finally left the bunker, like all grandpas sooner or later do.
 It's been good, extremely intense and sometimes difficult.
While I'm away, you guys take care of the grandma and more than anything of each other.
 Be good and respectful but let those who live at the bunker's top floors conspire, panic and argue with each other, without getting involved.
 Speak with Maurizio and with the guys from the portineria, instead.
As for me, I will finally set up my own business, a wedding cake one as you can see from the photo above.

Salute to Krol de Rueda 
   Krol, Fabrica's adored and esteemed writer (and this blog's darling), slipped out of the building last spring in the kind of impassioned, mysterious way typical of this mexican enigma.
 She continued writing for Fabrica from an undisclosed location on the great American continent.
 Recently, I persuaded her to write about her own experience here.
this is what she had to say:What was life like before Fabrica? As usual, surprising and unpredictable.
   I was freelancing graphic design in both Mexico and the US, as well as editing and writing about life and its mysterious ways.
 I was also learning, besides English, that life is way too short to stay still intimidated by your ideas and dreams.
 What was life like at Fabrica? Contradictory; painful, heartbreaking, frustrating, disappointing, but also fascinating, exhilarating, enriching, glorious.
 Life at Fabrica was full of that rare passion that turns the boredom of a customary life into the magical, the utopian and the extraordinary.
  Did you learn anything during your time here? In fact, everyday was a learning experience.
 I learned about Italian culture, falling in love with it.
 I learned about diversity, about fascinating cultures and recondite places, about sounds, ways of life and certainly about food.
  And at the end, in a place that deliberately denies the worries of adulthood and offers you a unique mental freedom that undresses your true personality, I realized how much I learned about myself.
 But I will never forget that beautiful three days birthday party (especially the Gargantua day!
), also night talking with Julia and Nam, balcony sun enjoying with Lizy, dance awakening with Mike and Nic, eat traveling with Anto, canal walking alone.
 Dinners with Christianitos parents, hot arguments with Nobu, ichating with Paolo, brujeando with Cosimo.
 Beer with fries after football, cooking for everyone, the gelato nights, dinners in Venice, Italian cover bands (especially Guns n Roses!
 And of course the bike rides, especially those when the city was sleeping.
 What a beautiful and peaceful place!
 Most memorable people? This is truly the best of Fabrica.
 The beautiful kiwi; the most wonderful and greater listener.
 And of course the formaggio ladies, who not matter what, where there for me five days a week.
 I am taking all of them home with me.
 Worst moments? Even that is contradictory at Fabrica, because when you leave, you miss the pain of the bad days, but at the same time, you suffer thinking about the old wonderful times.
What advice would you have wanted before coming here? Create without permission, collaborate with as many people as you can, share and find support to realize your projects, and dont fall in love with inexpensive good wine; is a deeply painful break up.
  Keep freelancing, keep learning, keep moving, keep dancing, keep listening.
 Any parting words? Lets start getting ready for the First Former Fabricanti Reunion (definitely!
) and of course, an enormous thanks to Mr Benetton, who believes in diversity, freedom and multiculturalism in the name of creativity.
 Krol, keep us posted.

Marta Teixeira da Silva has left the building 
   Before the hordes of Portuguese came in, there was Marta Teixeira da Silva.
 The wisest of us all, Marta distributed her inspiring words with the same elegance anywhere - from a cigarette break outside the Design Department to a big shot presentation at the Peggy Guggenheim in Venice.
 Back in her homeland, she announces: Lisboa continua muito boa!
 What was life like before Fabrica? I was in sunny Lisbon, working in Fabrica Features Lisboa, working together with Cristina Dias with whom I was also working in other projects - making special edition CD Packgings, all silk screen printed and hand made.
 What was life like at Fabrica? It was a great year.
 Had the chance to be part of some great projects, met a lot of beautiful and talented people, learned some italian and spanish and french, and even improved my portuguese serelepi from brazil.
 Had a lot of friends coming to visit, witch was also very nice.
 Had the honor to experiment some extraordinary recipes and some nice wine.
 It was a great and full year.
Most memorable moments? The memorable moments are always about the people which you share them with.
 But being in there is already a memorable moment.
 It's a very special place, where you have a completely different life than at home with very different people.
 Everything is intense, it's one year but it runs really fast.
 Will never forget some smiles and great moments even if they are stupid things like having a carrot screaming inside your oven.
What is the plan now? Back to Lisbon and enjoying every part of it and every friend.
 It's good to be back and being surprised again by beautiful things in this city that you tend not to forget.
 Working in some great projects and waiting for visits here in Lisbon.
 Have a lot of memorable moments.
Last words? Enjoy that time, be sincere and make the best out of that time in there but dont forget that its also good to go back to reality.

Giulia de Meo has left the building 
   The generous and gorgeous Giulia de Meo has gone.
 She will be remembered for patiently and positively refining all her work to brilliance, especially words, sacher-torte, and robot-dancing.
 The final results and the process have made a lot of people in this building extremely happy.
 Thanks for everything Giulia.
What was life like before Fabrica? After my graduation in philosophy I decided to get the one in  Semiotics, which is the most incredible subject ever.
 So I left Venice and I moved to Bologna for three years, where I lived with some friends and my sweet Charles Sanders Peirce, alias my cute cat EVVIVA.
Whatever I decided to do, it was a success.
 At school, with sports, at Uni.
 I am not proud of it at all: that was the worst thing that could happen to a young girl.
 Even if I could be satisfied with my life I was never happy, and I continuously felt emptiness inside me.
 I was missing something.
 Probably something like a home, a cousy, friendly place.
Last year  I started to work in several places and doing very different jobs: waitress, copy writer, bar-girl&and it was really a frustrating period!
 Then I went to Fabrica.
What was life like at Fabrica? It was hard at the beginning.
 There were graphics, photographers, video makers and other people with specific skills.
 I was& I was& What did Giulia exactly do at Fabrica?
 Nobody knew what was my job.
 And Fabricanti didnt even know that I was a student, because I have always come back home to Venice at night and I didnt share an apartment with them in Treviso.
 Just few people knew what Semiotics exactly meant, and I felt that I was not the best for the very first time.
 I felt I was definitely  IN THE WRONG PLACE.
I had to build my own space, to build my own specific objectives every day, step by step, and Fabrica gave me the chance to learn, to grow up.
 For this, I have to say thank you to Omar,cause hes always believed in me, even if I was not a graphic designer.
I have never found anything warmer than Fabrica in my life, and the friends I met there, managed to support me during this year, which has been quite difficult for me.
What did you learn at Fabrica? I learnt that to share something is the most beautiful thing in the world.
 That nothing is special if you cannot talk about it with a friend.
 That you dont have to be shy or ashamed of showing your weakness, and that the best results are those you didnt expect to see.
 Day by day you can build something that can always be improved.
 The process is more important than the prize.
 I learnt to be HAPPILY IN THE WORNG PLACE&Most memorable moments? Mio occhio non funziona (Lars); Da bambina avevo un coniglio (Valerie); HIIIIIIIC!

I have just started to work for an Agency not far from Venice.
 It takes just 45 minutes from my house (exactly half the time it took to me to arrive at Fabrica!
) and& its a real job.
 I am the responsible for the the communication and for the relations with journalists.
Finally I can write and be creative in Italian, which is my mother language.
Now a new adventures started.
 Im a bit scared but I felt stronger now, after almost a year at Fabrica.
 Thanks to my friends, di corsa.
 You made me get cheesy for the first time!

Scott Heinrich has left the building 
   Scott Heinrich departed Fabrica a few weeks ago, in a slow and careful manner - farewelling person by person.
 It was like when you take off a band-aid really really slow, releasing each hair, careful not to pull any out with you.
 Here is his farewell interview, the most articulate ever, with all you need to know about Fabrica as a place, experience, phenomena.
What was life like before Fabrica? Corporate and numb.
 Before applying to Fabrica I was generally irritated by my surroundings, work, culture, lifestyle, everything.
 But I was also very inspired.
 I have since learned that my subconscious revels and rebels in situations where I am generally disappointed with my situation.
 The result is a heightened and inspired state of consciousness.
 So in this sense (before Fabrica), I was motivated and determined to achieve something greater than what I had.
What was life like at Fabrica? Chaotic, inspiring, heartbreaking, uplifting, surreal and awe-inspiring.
 Bust most importantly it is what you make of it.
 Some people dislike chaos, but I love it.
 Chaos is where opportunity lies, and is where I was most productive.
 If Fabrica was organised and orderly, I would have not have experienced, collaborated, or experimented as much as I did.
As for our lifestyle, Fabrica is a bubble, completely void of reality yet also somehow symbolic of a lifetime.
 Emotionally (albeit abstractly) I experienced a birth, death, and marriage all within my scholarship.
 You make intense friendships that last on average of 4-6 months, which are soon followed by a farewell, and then repeated again and again.
 I feel very privileged to have met so many 'best friends' from all over the world, yet at times being so far removed from them can be very painful.
What did you learn at Fabrica? Fabrica untaught everything I thought I knew about being creative.
 I arrived a naive university graduate, and left two years later even more naive.
 This has been a process that I am most proud of.
 I have gained too many insights to list here, but there is one piece of advice from Enrico that has become even more relevant to me in recent weeks.
''ehh Scotta, you listen to me.
 You people think to much, its all in your mind.
 People, young people, think too hard about where they belong in the world, or they fantasise too much about their dreams.
 By the time you decide what you want to do, the race is already finished.
 Ehh, you understand?''  Enrico BossanBasically this means don't waste time daydreaming or holding out for grandeur.
 Stop thinking 'what if?' You have exactly what you need to start right now  yourself.
 I also learned that a flaw in the mentality of Fabricanti is in asking permission to work on personal projects, submitting themselves to the status quo, and accepting the defeat.
 I am not directing this at anyone specifically, but is more so an attitude that I have seen passed from one generation to the next.
 And an attitude that I am asking current and new Fabricanti to change for the good of all future generations.
During my first year at Fabrica I found myself to be in a position of creative autism.
 Here was an environment where I was absorbing so much information and inspiration daily, that I lost clarity of what I was trying to achieve.
 This induced a constant state of daydreaming, which is euphoric and fantastical, but self-destructive if you are intending to be productive.
 And seeing as most of us enter Fabrica with high expectations, these distractions (and others) can become a real problem.
 Phoebe and Babak both individually helped me in controlling these distractions, but it wasn't until I encountered the writings of Gertrude Stein that I truly understood how to create what she describes as an 'inspired feedback loop', a way of balancing chaos (inspiration) with productivity.
I guess what Im saying is that yes there are problems and distractions within Fabrica, but this is true for all large creative organisations, or even solo pursuits.
 It is very difficult to ask 25 young creatives to conform to one structure, or one model of working.
 In the end it seems best to remain flexible and willing for anarchy to reign, while also maintaining a balance of control in order to be productive.
 This applies to Fabrica as a collective as well as to the students individually.
I am truly grateful to have gained such insights, and I encourage other Fabricanti to do the same.
Most memorable moments? During my final week in Treviso, I realised how full of memories these medieval laneways had become.
 Each street corner housed the celebration of a birthday, arrival or farewell.
 It felt as if I were already experiencing a past life.
But most vividly I remember the bar where I first met Phoebe, the markets where I would meet Lars every Saturday morning, and Mama's Pizzeria (aka Gianburrasca) where Brad and I would talk about girls, films, and the injustices of Fabrica.
And now? Three weeks ago, I moved back to Adelaide (Austraia) where I am now freelancing as an art director, and continuing my experiments and development into the realm of video making.
 I hope to start making documentaries about farmers in the Australian outback, because while I was abroad I realised that 'country Australia' has its own unique dialect that is considered foreign by the rest of the world.
 A characteristic I now find fascinating.
Last words? I hope my answers are not sounding pessimistic, because I feel quite the opposite.
 Every day I was surrounded by amazingly talented individuals who just by their presence fill you with hope and confidence.
 Letting go of this community is by far the hardest part of leaving Fabrica.
As for the new Fabricanti, and old ones.
Dont become too comfortable or take things for granted.
 Never wait for your opportunities, always chase them.
 Collaborate at all costs.
 Agitate, question, and support each other.
 At all times, have ONE (and only one) concise vision for YOURSELF and your personal project.
 It's easy to be distracted by commercial work or false initiatives, so the more focused you remain, the more likely you will achieve your dream goal.
 Most importantly, enjoy what you do.
 You're living in Utopia right now.
comThanks Scott, for your support of everything and everyone, and buon viaggio for your next creative journey.

Jin Kang has left the buildingThe most shy, gentle and polite guy ever will soon join .
   What were you doing before Fabrica, and what are your plans now? Before coming here I was working as a freelancer for several companies.
 Prior to that I was studying.
 And of course I used to listen to the music all the time, as I did at Fabrica.
 But what I loved the most was to work as a voluntary designer for non-commercial companies.
 Next year Im gonna work in the Korean Army, but I want to start again my voluntary work as well.
Was Fabrica what you expected it to be? I think the people are even more important than the work, here at Fabrica.
 This is exactly what I expected to find here.
Did you learn anything during your time here? I learnt to speak English, (at least, better than before!
) to control myself, and how to talk to different kinds of people.
Best moments in Treviso? Last week, at Pushkars party: I got drunk for the very first time.
 I was really confused, but happy!
Anything else you would like to say? I will miss everybody, and I hope to see you again else where, in the future.
  Just as adult people in the real world.

Francesca Wade has left the building 
   Magical Francesca, known for making amazing things appear from nothing, like thurs-day-night movies,  and "do" projects, and wonders made of mere fabric and cotton, has herself now disappeared from these hallways.
leaving behind a trail of heartbroken brazilians.
What were you doing before Fabrica, and what are your plans now? Just before Fabrica, I was working at a lovely design company in London, and helping Ian Wright plan his move to New York.
 For anyone who doesn't know his work, check it out.
 Prior to that I was studying in at the University of Brighton.
 I am back in London, adapting to postFabrica life, looking forward to my first job offer and coming to terms with the rain.
Was Fabrica what you expected it to be? Fabrica was much less and much more than I expected it to be.
 It's definitely not what you think it is  whoever you are, wherever you come from  but it is rewarding in ways that you can never expect.
Did you learn anything during your time here? It's a huge life experience.
 You live, you learn.
 Believe it or not, I am calmer, more patient and a great deal more open to suggestions than I was before.
 Being at Fabrica teaches you to see your normality's as strange preferences that are always subject to change.
Best moments in Treviso? Barbara's long lunches.
 Lawrence lifting people up into the air, literally.
  Sitting opposite Marta at work.
 Recently, waking Marta up in the morning in a Romeo and Juliet fashion, without the romance.
 Being on my bike, going anywhere and everywhere with Fernando.
 Filming the love scene with Piero and Laura for The Duel  ALOHA!
  and in fact, everything to do with the making of the film.
 Poker at Ben's house, listening to pretty much any ridiculous story he had to tell  and there were many!
  Hanging out with Benjamin.
 Throwing playing cards around the apartment with Gabo.
 Scott's face painting for the Venice Carnival.
 Evenings with Erik and Valentina.
 Waiting for Joao to arrive, standing on the balcony looking down to the road like excited children.
 My goodbye party  thank you!
Last words? To those newcomers who may like to question the system  don't waste your time!
 Find your niche and nurture it.

Our inspirational all-round-great-american-guy has left us.
 The one that proved it was possible to learn italian, win the affections of italian women, men, all fabricanti, and integrate smoothly into italian culture, including coloured pants.
    Brad showing the trappings of his "when in rome" philosophyWhat was life like before Fabrica? I bounced around the globe quite a bit for both work and for personal experience.
 I was freelancing as a director/shooter/editor so that gave me the freedom to live like a hobo, but a little more professional.
Most memorable moments? Wandering down to Puglia (the 'heal' of Italy), looking up the address of where my grandma was born, and cruising around that neighborhood.
 People started to find out what I was up to, so they would take me door to door trying to find someone that might be related to me.
 Next thing I know, I'm in the dining room of a family with the same last name as my grandparents.
 They kept feeding me and pouring homemade wine down my throat, so we sat and talked for hours.
 We never figured out if we were related, but enjoyed the afternoon all the same.
And of course& Ogni momento con Tito e Mario, i miei migliori e pi scemi amici a Treviso!
 Fratelli, voi ne avete fatta mille volte pi bella la mia esperienza in italia.
  Vi ringrazio per tutto che mi avete fatto!
Every conversation at "Mom's Pizzeria" or at the "Old Man Bench" or just at the apartment with Scott.
 I'll miss you bro, come visit soon!
Working CRAZY hours writing with Lottie, psychotically punching out scripts and ideas.
 Writing with Donovan, and releasing some of the most ridiculous concepts that have come out of my brain in a long time.
Traveling around the world with Alex, filming in some quite different situations, but having a good teammate throughout the whole experience.
Pranzo con Enrico e tutti da Advertising, "no olio& no party.
"And every single morning over a year and a half when I woke up, looked outside, and said to myself, "Wow, I'm actually living in Italy.
"What is the plan now? I just spent some time back at home in Phoenix, Arizona eating some good home cookin' with the family and catching up with old friends.
 I plan on buying a surfboard right away and most likely hurting myself really badly shortly thereafter.
For my own projects, I want to keep shooting short films, but with content and a method that just makes me happy doing it from beginning to end.
 There's nothing more exciting than creating something and realizing that you've had a smile on your face throughout the entire process.
comBrad, you are dearly missed.

Tad Kimball has left the building 
   Tad, the yellow wearing, ubertalented, ubermodest, web-foraging, 80's speaking, good-natured american of few words (but very very good ones) has left the building.
What was life like pre-Fabrica? Before Fabrica, I was living and working in New York at a big advertising firm specializing in branding.
 When I wasn't working I was riding bikes, laying on the roof, going on weekend adventures and watching a lot of movies.
What was life like at  Fabrica? At Fabrica things were pretty good, especially towards the end of my stay.
 There were a lot of ups and downs, but there were always great people and great food and drink around to make things better.
What did you learn at Fabrica? I learned how to deal with a lot of different types of people.
 I also feel like I learned to be more confident.
Most memorable moments? Some of the most memorable moments are a little foggy unfortunately, but some of my favorite memories revolve around bike rides down the river.
What's the plan now? The plan now is to enjoy being back in NY before I get sick of it again.
 Spending time with Megan and my friends and going to the beach a lot are also up there on the list.
 We are very sorry that we couldn't keep him here longer, but know he is going back to better things (namely NY and his fiance Megan) and we wish him it all.
Thanks for for all the love you gave to the blog.
 It will miss you very much.

Matt Prins has left the buildingA good man unexpectedly left, leaving a terrible emptiness and a dreadful silence around the creative writing department.
 No more singing, no more mechanic talking, no more story telling.
  Fabricas talented, honest and most photogenic man, left in our hearts pure sadness and sorrow.
    From left to right: mysterious hand, fabricante, ex fabricante, trial.
  Right corner: our lonely little Matt.
 What was your life like pre-Fabrica?
  I studied screenwriting in Vancouver then went directly into working at a dry ice factory, and lived in my parent's basement.
 I applied to Fabrica a couple of months later.
 I checked my email every few hours for six months for a response.
 When I finally heard back from Monica I had just given up hope, so it was a very nice surprise.
   What was life like during Fabrica?
 I fucking hated it at times, but loved the shit out of it far more often.
 As humdrum as it can seem, life in Fabrica is a constant guessing game.
  What are you most proud of doing in your time here?
 I think a lot of people come to Fabrica expecting it to be a wonderful creative year where they'll get to explore their practice, and then they end up doing what Benetton or the UN or Omar asks them to do.
 I'll just do a great job on this poster about Spousal Abuse and have a drink at San Tomasso to take the edge off.
"     What advice would you have wanted before coming here?
   People are going to talk about you behind your back, but don't take it to heart, because everyone talks about everyone behind everyone's backs.
 That's just what happens when you're living, working, drinking, eating, traveling and sleeping with the same 40 people that everyone else is living, working, drinking, eating, traveling and sleeping with.
  Best and worst moments?
  3 Very Great Moments: Cross-dress party and following morning, trip to NY with Reed, and any amount of time spent with any member of "the clique," (completely opposed to that label by the way) and the clique-extended family (that's you Cosimo.
) 3 Very Bad moments: death threats from Bloodfists, saying bye to Reed Nat Pia and Miren in the span of 6 weeks, going to Rome when I was meant to go to the beach.
  What's the plan now?
  Dry ice and parent's basement.
 Any thanks to give?
   I fell in love and/or felt complete admiration and fondness with and for so many people, hundreds surely, in these 20 months.
 It's amazing how much love you have to give and take.
 To EVERY ONE person i met from my trial to my goodbye party - thank you.
 We all wish you the very best.

Michael Ciancio has left the buildingNo more lentil soups, no more remixes, no more umbrellas.
 It was Michaels time, dearest friend, unstoppable dancer, exceptional creative, honest soul and eternal lover of food, to go back home.
   Salud Mike, we all wish you the best!
    Ciancio has always appreciated the Italian cultureWhat did you do before Fabrica? I finished my undergrad at MICA and worked at Hyperakt Design Group   in Brooklyn, NY and some freelance here and there.
What's the plan now? I'll continue to be the fat kid that I am deep down insideliving in   Italy really contributed to this.
 My next big trip involves me flying   to Vancouver and driving to San Francisco stopping in Seattle and   Portland.
 I'm freelancing till further notice and   living in Astoria.
Did you learn anything during your time here? I learnt that tacos are actually not supposed to have sour cream in   them.
 I learnt that Aussies and Kiwis kinda hate each other but don't   admit it.
 I learnt that English people wear crowns during Christmas.
   I learnt that Portugal is pretty.
 I learnt more Italian, and I learnt   how to say Cheers in many languages.
Best and worst moments? My worst moments were not even that bad now that I think about it.
 My   wallet fell out of my pocket once while I was biking the day after my   4th of July party.
 And so, I canceled all my credit and bank cards,

                                               The title I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you signifies an unfulfilled relationship, an                   unbalanced equation, a situation in need of another person.
 I&rsquo;ve been waiting                   for you is a show where the artwork is unstable &ndash; where the exhibited works                   are only the catalyst for the creation of a sense of sociability, and in which                   the viewer is required to play the protagonist and complete the work.
 This is                   a show that demands intervention from the audience and in turn offers the                   resulting encounter as the art itself.
                                    Although each installation in the exhibition uses at least one computer,                   I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you is not about technology, but rather about the                   things which technologies allow us to do.
 The show reflects the emerging                   aesthetics of media arts in which networks, interfaces and sensors play an increasingly important role in the creative process.
 However, I&rsquo;ve been                   waiting for you is primarily informed by older debates about the nature of                   art, the artist and the audience, reaching back from Bourriaud&rsquo;s &lsquo;Relational                   Aesthetics&rsquo; through Fluxus and beyond, whilst at the same time exploring                 the languages and the poetics of interactivity as an artform.

 The viewer is invited to participate by uploading their camera phone images and videos of local people, places and things to the installation.
 As the installation fills up with donated personal media, the nature and portrait of the local community emerges over the period of the exhibit.
                                                 Local Channels installation uses CommPose, a project originally created to to explore new communication methods with camera phones.
 To date, CommPose has been exhibited and collected camera phone media in Korea, Thailand, Italy, and Canada.
